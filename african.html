<div class="descendantDiv">We have two African-American participants in our Wolcott/Walcott DNA project; one a Walcott and one a Wilcott. Their DNA tests show unrelated descent in the male lines, both with origins in Central Africa. We encourage other black Wolcotst, Walcotst and Wilcotts to partcipate.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">Some African-American Walcotts have achieved significant positions in the world. Most black Walcotts originated in Barbados and Jamaica, where white Walcotts were early settlers and slaveholders. It is often difficult to find if they are related, as most took surnames after slavery was abolished in Barbados and Jamaica in 1834, following the British Slavery Abolition Act of 1833. This is also true of many black Americans descended from slaves brought to the United States, who adopted surnames following the Civil War.

<div class="descendantDiv">Notable African-American Walcotts include:
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">"Jersey Joe" Walcott, born New Jersey in 1914. He fought Joe Louis for the championship in 1947, and became World Heavyweight Boxing Champion in 1951 by defeating Ezard Charles. Joe's birth name was Arnold Cream.  When he got into professional fighting, he took the name, Joe Walcott. Arnold's father had been born in the British West Indies, and his father's favorite fighter was from the same region, Joe Walcott, the Welterweight Champion.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">The original Joe Walcott was born in British Guiana in 1873, but grew up in Barbados. He got a job as a cabin boy on a sailing ship and sailed to Boston where he got a job in a gym, and started boxing. Joe was under 5 ft. 2 in. and weighed less than 150 pounds, but he had an 18 in. neck and a 41 in. chest; impressive for his size.  He sometimes fought and beat Light Heavyweights and Heavyweights. He was called "The Barbados Demon". In 1901 he became World Welterweight Champion, a title he held until 1904, when he accidentally shot himself in the hand during a New Year's celebration. He is credited with originating the saying: "The bigger they are, the harder they fall."
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">Another Joe Walcott, known as "Fighting Joe" Walcott, was also well known in the world of boxing. He was born in New Orleans in 1904 and came north to Philadelphia for better opportunities. Walcott, a lightweight, boxed about 200 fights before he became a trainer in the 1930s. He trained World Champions Joe Frazier, Jersey Joe Walcott, and Earnie Terrell. For many of his fighters, Walcott was a stern father-figure. To support his own family, Walcott also washed windows for about 30 years. He helped organize a local unit of the window cleaners' union.  One day, while hanging from 20 stories up on a Center City highrise, one of Walcott's belts loosened. He would have plunged to his death if not for his strength to hold on to the ropes. He died in Philadelphia in 1998.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">Sir Clyde Leopold Walcott, born in Bridgetown, Barbados in 1926, was a world famous cricket player.  His father was an engineer with the Barbados Advocate, the island's only newspaper. Clyde was born borderline Barbadian upper-class in New Orleans, St Michael Parish, in the comfort of a home built for a plantation manager.  In the 1950s he was considered the best batsman in the world. From 1954 to 1970, he lived in British Guiana, which in 1966 achieved independence as the nation of Guyana. There he played for and captained the national team while also developing its cricket program. He retired from active playing in 1960, and became the first non-English and non-white chairman of the International Cricket Council. In 1966 he was granted knighthood by the government of Barbados as Knight of St. Andrew, Gold Crown of Merit.

<div class="descendantDiv">A current star in the world of Soccer is Theo James Walcott. He was born in London in 1989 to a Jamaican father and an English mother, Don and Lynn Walcott. Wendell Walcott, Theo's grandfather, moved to England from Jamaica in the 1950s. Theo was born in London, but the family moved to Compton when he was 10.

When Theo was picked to play for England for the 2006 World Cup, the whole family, mother Lynn, a midwife; brother Ashley and sister Holly, flew to Baden-Baden to be near him. Theo shunned the luxurious England quarters for the modest hotel where his family stayed. He has still not been known to enter a nightclub and does not drink alcohol. On 6 April 2008, Walcott was a torchbearer for the Olympic Flame as it was paraded around London. He retired in 2023.

<div class="descendantDiv">Nobel Prize Winner, Derek Alton Walcott, was born in 1830 on the island of St. Lucia, in the Carribean. Both his grandmothers were said to have been the descendants of slaves. His mother, Alix, ran the town's Methodist school. His father, Warwick Walcott, was a civil servant working in the Office of the Attorney General. Warwick was an amateur artist, and an opera fan. He died at age 34, when Derek and his twin brother, the future playwright Roderick Walcott, were only a few years old. Warwick's father, Charles Walcott, was white, and a member of the Barbados Walcott family. He came to St. Lucia and bought a plantation, where he had 5 children by a local woman of mixed race. The first poem Derek published was a religious poem. He was then only 14 years old. In the newspaper, an English Catholic priest condemned the Methodist-inspired poem as blasphemous. By 19, he had self-published his two first collections of poems, which he distributed himself. He later said, "I went to my mother and said, 'I'd like to publish a book of poems, and I think it's going to cost me two hundred dollars.' She was just a seamstress and a schoolteacher, and I remember her being very upset because she wanted to do it. Somehow she got it—a lot of money for a woman to have found on her salary. She gave it to me, and I sent off to Trinidad and had the book printed. When the books came back I sold them to friends. I made the money back." Derek obtained a scholarship and studied at the University of the West Indies in Kingston, and then moved to Trinidad in 1953, becoming a critic, teacher and journalist.  He then taught literature and writing at Boston University, retiring in 2007. Walcott was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1992, the first Caribbean writer to receive the honor. He died at. St. Lucia in 2017.
