<div class="descendantDiv">The fourth Wolcott family to come to America was that of John Woolcott of Kent County MD. He was born about 1630, but his parents and place of birth are unknown. He immigrated to Maryland in 1649, and was the ancestor of the Wolcotts who lived in Talbot Co. MD. The Wolcott/Walcott/Wilcott DNA project shows that the Maryland Wolcotts are closely related to the descendants of Philip Willcutt of Hingham MA, c.1690-1771, and to a descendant William Woolcott of Exeter, Devonshire, 1770-1842. These three were probably all descendants of the Woolcott family of Thrushelton, Devonshire. Hopefully, additional descendants of the Devonshire Wolcotts will participate in this DNA study to help clarify relationships. Information about the DNA project may be found by returning to the index and going to the DNA web page.

<hr class="thick">
<div class="descendantDiv">(1) John Wolcott, b. c.1630 England, d. 1669 Kent Co. MD, surgeon; immigrated to MD in 1649.  In 1657 John Wallcott was awarded 1,700 pounds of tobacco for attending and dressing 32 prisoners. John was a Quaker, named in a document recording the Sufferings of Quakers, c.1660: "John Woollcott had taken from him by John Norwood, sheriff, because he could not train, to the value of five pounds five shillings." John Norwood was sheriff of Anne Arundel Co., Maryland, 1650-1662.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">In 1667 a patent was issued to John Woollcott of Kent Co., surgeon, for 40 acres of land called Walcotte Addition located near the head of Beaver Neck Creek adjoining the land of William Hensley, part of a warrant for 350 acres previously granted him; in a Kent Co. assize hearing of 1667-8 John and Gertrude Anderson complained that John Woollcott had "deceized" the said Gertrude of her freehold called Beaver Neck.  John replied that the 100 acres was granted to John Salter in 1658 and bequeathed to his wife Jane who conveyed it to William Hensley, surgeon, who conveyed it to John Woollcott. John was declared the legal owner in 1668; William Hensley had a grant of 100 acres at Pentridge in Kent Co. in 1670.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">John arranged for the passage of several persons to America as indentured servants. A passenger list from the Bristol Records Office, dated 1660, records: "Eliz. Savage, spinster, and Richard Pullin, yeoman, bound to John Woolcot to serve 4 years in Maryland. Maryland deeds, Book 5 Folio 467, reads: "I, John Walcutt, do assign over unto Thomas Bradley or his assigns all my right and title of land due for transportation of myself who came in the year 1649, Richard Pullaine in 1660, John Davis in 1660, Elizabeth Savage in 1660. Witness my hand and seal this 18th September 1663. John Woolcott." In 1669 the following was recorded in the Kent Co. MD court: "John Woolcott brought a servant to court named Ellenor Hutchins who is ordered to serve six yeares but in case any indenture be found or any evidence that she sett her hand to an indenture but for foure yeares that at the expiration of the time to be free or els to serve according to order." In 1669 an inventory of the estate of Nicholas Picard of Kent MD included a debt to John Woolcot of "1682," probably &pound16, 8s 2d.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">John died in 1669. His will reads: "This 13 day of the month called March 1669, I, John Woolcott of Kent in the Province of Maryland being sick and weake in body but in perfect mind and memory doe make this my last will and testament in manor and forme as followeth.  First I freely resine unto God the father in the name of my Lord and Saver Jesus Christ my soule body and spirit bleeving there is no other name given under heaven whereby I can be saved. And what is really and personally any manor of ways belonging or may belong unto me I doe freely give and bequeath unto my dear and loving wife Sarah Woolcott after al my just debts are satisfied and doe make her my sd wife Sarah Woolcott whole and sole executrix of all and every my whole estate for her to peacebly injoy forever and hereby reevoaking all other wills deeds of what kinnd soever, also my will is and I doe hearby apoint my dear friend Thomas Taylor of Kent and Peter Sharpe of the Cliffs and William Bevery (Berry) of Patuxent my overseers to assist her my said executrix as need shall require as witness my hand and seal the day and year above wrighten. "  The will was signed in the presence of Fra. Neal.   The will was probated in 1677 with Francis Neale, age 28, as witness; Francis would have been 20 at the time the will was drawn and because of his youth it seems likely he was John's apprentice.   Another document of 1677 says: "The said Woolcot in his lifetime made his Last Will & Testament in writing and constituted her the said widow Thomas his late wife his exix only of the said testament and in his will had appointed his orphans their respective parts & shares of his land, that the deceased personal estate is ... very inconsiderable, that for the preservation of the said orphans rights to the land a comission is by her ernestly desired...." The will was re-filed at Chestertown in 1713 by John Pitt, possibly so the property could be inherited or sold. Taylor, Sharp, Berry, Neal, and Pitt were all Quakers.  John's wife witnessed a Quaker marriage in 1669. There were three Quaker meetings at this time, at Kent Island, Bayside, and Betty's Cove on the Miles River, apparently meeting in member's homes.

In 1745 he and William Slow were granted recognizane for Ann Slow, William's wife, accused of adultery and found not guilty. In 1751, James Woolcott of Talbot Co. MD subscribed 10s for the charity school for orphans in St. Peters parish. The relationship between James and Joseph is unknown, but a John Dowdle who m.
