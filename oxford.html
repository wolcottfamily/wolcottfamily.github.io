<div class="descendantDiv">The surname of this family may derive from a hamlet named Wilcote at Quinton, Gloucester, named in the Domesday records.  The family is sometimes said to have been a branch of the Rainsford family because of their use of the Rainsford arms "Azure, an eagle displayed argent, ducally gorged or." The family flourished for less than 200 years and is now thought to be extinct in the male line. Most Wilcotts who lived in the United States have been shown by historical records or DNA tests of their descendants to be descendants of Wolcott families, and not from this family.

In 1397 he purchased the manor of Willecote in Gloucestershire; he also held the adjascent manor of Alvescot in Preston on Stour.  In 1399 he received a royal grant of the manor of Hedington, with the hundreds of Bullington and Northgate, Oxfordshire, for which he paid 30s annually to the King, and was made custodian of Cornbury Park 1402-1412. In 1402 Henry IV granted to William Willicotes, esq., and his heirs, free warren in all his demesne lands of Willicote or Alvescote in the County of Gloucestershire, and in the manors of Ipwell, Walcote, and Wodepary in the county of Oxford. He purchased rents and reversion of lands at Northleigh, and jointly with John Norbury was granted the farm of the manor of Woodstock and hundred of Wootton from the queen, Joanna of Navarre, which King Henry said: "of our special favor and for the laudable services which our beloved gentlemen, John Norbury and William Wilcotes, now deceased, had conferred upon us, we have granted and to farm let to the same John and William our manors of Woodstock, Hamburgh, Wotton, and Stonfield, with all their members and hamlets and other profits, and all their appurtenances, and also our hundred of Wotton... for the term of our life... rendering yearly 175 pounds...." In 12 Henry IV William is returned as having died seized of "tur et reddit in Northlye, Wealicott, Wodeparye and Ypwell, co. Oxon", and the manor of Hedington in socage for himself and his heirs at a yearly rent of 40 pounds and that Thomas Willecot was his son and heir; m. c.1380 Elizabeth, dau. and heiress of Sir John Trillowe of Chasleton, Warwickshire, and had as her dowry the manors of Chastleton, lying in Oxford, Gloucester, Worcester, and Warwickshire, and Saltford, Warwick and lands in Northleigh, Oxford; in c,1410 Elizabeth inherited the manor of Wilcote from her nephew Thomas Perrot.  2 sons, 5 dau..

Elizabeth Blaket obtained a licence in mortmain to found a chantry with an endowment for two priests.  Her two sons, Thomas and John Willecotes, joined with her in the application for the license, as appears in the letters patents; and this is a reason why the effigy may be considered to be that of her former husband, who was their father, and not of Sir John Blaket. Sir William Wilcote and his wife Lady Elizabeth Blacket were once believed to travel around the village in a phantom coach. Their ghosts are believed to have been laid by a team of priests. She d. in 1445, seized of the manor of Wodepary, Madecroft, and Horley Close, Oxfordshire, and other lands ; bur. Northleigh church; the Wilcote tomb has on it the arms: a chevron engrailes between 3 escallops and on the other side a spread eagle.
