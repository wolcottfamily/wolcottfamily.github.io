<hr class="thick">

<div class="descendantDiv">It was once believed that the Wolcott family of Somerset were descendants of the Walcot family of Shropshire. Later it appeared that the Somerset Wolcotts may have descended from the Woolcott family of Devonshire, which dates back to the 13th century. DNA evidence shows both are untrue. It is now certain that Somerset Wolcotts descend from a separate male ancestor who took his surname from a property called Woolcott, in the parish of Brompton Regis, formerly known as King's Brompton, Somerset, about 5 miles northeast of Dulverton.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">The manor of Brompton Regis belonged to Barlinch Priory.  A document listing the properties of the priory in 1339 included land in Wlfletecot, given to the priory by John de Forestarius, all land that Walter Cridel and heirs have in Wlfletecot and Blakedon, all land and tenements that Robert de Wlfletecot has in Wlfletecot being a half furlong in Wlfletecot and a half furlong in Blakedon, land that Jordan Wlfletecot has of Robert of Radashangre being a half furlong in Wlfletecot and a half furlong in Blakedon, land that Richard Kichenoch has in Wlfletecot; and the service that Nicholas de Wlfletecot and his heirs owe for land of Hurscombe. Hurscombe was a farm adjacent to Woolcotts, now covered by Wimbleball Lake. 
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">In 1359, Gilbert Scut held lands in Wolfetecote and Westcote in Brompton Regis, which his daughter, Joan quit-claimed to her sister, Alice, and Alice's husband, Walter de Wolferdcote, in 1368, one of the witnesses being William de Wolferdecote. Walter Wolfcote witnessed another deed at Brompton Regis in 1368. In 1399 John Davy deeded land in the manor of Brompton Regis to John Wolfcote, who, in turn, deeded land to Walter Withers the same year. In 1401 Richard Bagheton and Adam Westcote, brother of John Wolfcote, deeded land at Brompton Regis to John Wolfcote and Thomasine his wife. Westcote was another property in Brompton Regis, so the brothers can more properly be called John de Wolfcote and Adam de Westcote. In 1463 John Wolfcote, son and heir of John Wolfcote deeded land at Brompton Regis to William Grenning. At this time Wolfcote seems to have become a proper surname rather than the name of a residence. This indicates that the surname is not derived from the sheep wool industry as has been suggested, but rather from the Anglo-Saxon given name prefix, 
	Wulf, and cot or house.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">In 1316, part of the manor of Brompton Regis was held be Geoffrey de Besiles. An inquisition taken at Dunster in 1406 at the death of Katherine, widow of Sir Thomas de Besiles, states that she held as widow's dowery, together with land in Berkshire and Oxfordshire, one third of the manor of Brompton Regis for life, a house and 34 acres at Hestercombe, and a toft (a house with outbuildings) and 16 acres in Wollcote, from her son, Peter de Besiles, lord of the manor of Kings Brompton. Peter died in 1426, leaving his manor of Kings Brompton to Barlinch Priory as perpetual alms. Hestercombe, where Katherine held a house and land in 1406, was owned from 1392 by the Warre family. Sir Richard Warre of Hestercombe, who died in 1601, was the father of John Warre who inherited Chipleigh and Tolland Manors.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">A record of pews in the Brompton Regis church show that in 1629 a pew in the women's section was assigned to Higher Woolcott and John Hiller of Hosworthy. Another row in this section was assigned to the family of John Greenslade at Woolcott. John Greenslade at Woolcott also had a row in the men's section.  Row 1 of the side aisle, another women's section, was the pew for Lower Woolcott.  In another section for women were the seats for Widow Hurford of Woolcott and behind it a pew for Witherow of Nether Woolcott.  Outside of John Greenslade, the women of Woolcotts were apparently all widows. Woolcott was apparently at that time separate properties, Woolcott, Higher Woolcott, Lower Woolcott, and Nether Woolcott, a cluster of houses which would be called a hamlet. 
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">In an 1819 covenant deed, Woolcotts is listed as two distinct properties, Woolcotts and Denis' Woolcott. The latter was owned by the Dennys/Denys family of Barnstable and Tiverton in the 18th century. In 1875, Lower Woolcott Farm in Kings Brompton, containing 217 acres, was occupied by William Corner. Today there are two Woolcott farms in Brompton Regis: Higher Woolcott, a 15th century five bedroom house, and Lower Woolcott, an 18th century 3 bedroom farmhouse.  There is now also a two bedroom holiday rental, a converted barn, called Woolcotts Cross Cottage.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">William and Thomas Wolcot appear on the 1524/5 Lay Sybsidy tax roll for the parish of Tolland, Somerset, about 20 miles east of Brompton Regis. They were two out of the total of eleven land holders in Tolland. On this roll, heads of households and individuals age 16 and over were taxed on either their land, goods or labor, whichever was greatest, but those with less that 1 pound per year were not taxed.  One pound was the normal valuation of a farm laborer.  Each individual was only taxed once even though he had property in more than one location. Thomas Wolcot was taxed on land at Tolland valued at &pound5 per year with a tax of 2 shillings 6 pence, and William Wolcot on land at Tolland valued at &pound3 per year with a tax of 18 pence.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">Most of the 1524/5 Somerset tax rolls have never been published.  The 1524/5 subsidy roll for Freemanors Hundred, which included Brompton Regis and Tolland, is only partially preserved, with Brompton Regis missing. Three Wolcott familes are listed at other locations on the roll: John Wolcot of Kilton, a village 10 miles north of Brompton Regis, had land valued at &pound8 and a tax of 3 shillings, John Wolcott of Stogumber, a village some 20 miles northwest of Brompton Regis, for wages worth &pound1 6 pence, was taxed at 4 pence; and John Wolcot of Monksilver, a village 2 miles west of Stogumber, for wages worth &pound1, was taxed at 4 pence. Elizabeth Woolcott, widow, of Nettlecombe held property let in 1522. There may have been other Wolcotts in the missing pages and surrounding Hundreds, but this subsidy roll indicates that by 1524 Wolcotts had spread from Brompton Regis to nearby parishes. The complete 1524-5 Subsidy Rolls for Tolland can be found at the end of these pages.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">The 1500 will of a William Wulcote of Dulverton, a market town 6 miles southwest of Brompton Regis, was proved in 1530. William's will mentions his wife, Elizabeth, and several godchildren, but no children. William Wolcote of Dulverton, husbandman, was a defendent in 1525 when Christopher Clogge sued William Wolcote, Alice William, widow, and Christopher, Thomas, and John Chilcott, all of Dulverton for trespass. The record for Dulverton is missing from the 1524/5 tax roll.
</div>


<hr class="thick">

<div class="descendantDiv">WOLCOTTS OF TOLLAND:
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">Among documents which belonged to Henry Wolcott, the immigrant, is an ancient manuscript dated 1618, conveying to Henry's brother, Christopher Wolcott, land in the parishes of Tolland and Lydiard St. Lawrence in the county of Somerset "which now are or lately were parcel of the Manor of Gauldon." Henry Wolcott inherited these lands when Christopher died in 1639. American Wolcotts came to believe that the property Henry Wolcott inherited from his brother was the principle residence at Tolland known today as "Gauldon Manor". An Inquest Post Mortem, taken at the time that Christopher Wolcott died, however, shows that the property purchased by Christopher was only a small part of the manor, consisting of two houses and a mill. One of these houses, with the adjacent mill, is now a residence called Watersmeet Farm.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">In 1500, Tolland parish contained two manors, Gauldon Manor owned by the monks of Taunton Priory, and Tolland Manor owned by the Warre family. Another small portion was part of Chipleigh manor at Nettlecombe. Tolland was an agricultural community, composed of about twelve farms and some agricultural laborers who worked for the farmers. The parish had a church and a rectory with glebe land. The only industry other than agriculture was the wool cloth trade.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">The Priory at Taunton leased out the Gauldon Manor properties and collected the rents. In 1520 John Selleck leased from Taunton Priory the principal farm in the manor and a fulling mill adjoining it for life, with successive leases to his wife Agnes and their sons, John and Henry Selleck. This is the house known today as "Gauldon Manor". In 1525, John Selleck and John Stodden were the largest land holders in parish. John Stodden left the parish soon after, but the Selleck family stayed on.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">In 1539, Taunton Priory surrendered all its lands, including the manor of Gauldon, to Henry VIII. In 1544, the manor was sold by the Crown for &pound212 to William Standish of London. William Standish died in 1553, and the manor went to his daughter, Alice Southwell. Alice Southwell died childless, and Gauldon then went to the Mynne family in accordance with the purchase deed. The Mynnes sold Gauldon Farm, occupied by Robert Sellake, a fulling mill adjoining, Gauldon Wood of twelve acres, and two enclosed lots of eight acre, to John Turberville in 1615. Most of the remainder, including the Tolland grist mill, was sold to Christopher Wolcott in 1618.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">The names of William and Thomas "Wolcot" appear in 1525 on the earliest existing tax roll naming residents of Tolland, and also on the Tolland subsidy rolls of 1535 and 1539. The 1539 tax roll is the last time William Wolcott's name appears at Tolland, so he probably died soon after this. We do not know his relationship to Thomas, but he was probably Thomas' father or brother. Thomas appears to have been the ancestor of all other Tolland Wolcotts.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(1) Thomas Wolcott, c.1490-c.1555, listed with William Wolcott on the 1525, 1535, and 1539 tax roll. He was the only Wolcott listed on the Tolland tax rolls in 1550 where he is listed as a "tucker". Tucking and fulling were names for the finishing process of cloth making, in which newly woven wool cloth was prepared for sale by soaking and beating, usually by means of a water driven mill. Gauldon Farm and a tucking mill adjacent to it were leased to John Selleck in 1520, above. Thomas Wolcott was a property owning adult in 1525 and still alive in 1559, so he was born sometime around 1500. Thomas' name is found in several wills of the period. The will of Elizabeth Hervye of Tolland, dated 1550 and proved in 1559, has Thomas Wolkot as a witness. The will of William Howe of Tolland, dated 1551 and proved 1561, has Thomas Wolcott, the elder, as a witness. This will also mentions a debt due from John Wolcott for eleven yards of raw cloth. The will of John Seller of Tolland, dated 1553 and proved in 1558, also has Thomas Wolcott, the elder, as witness. The information in the 1986 Wolcott Genealogy that Thomas was born in 1487, died 5 June 1554, and was married to a Margaret Welling, appears to be fabricated, as he left no will, and birth, marriage, death records don't begin at Tolland until 1598, and no other records have been found to support this. Thomas was the father of all of the next generation of Tolland Wolcotts, Thomas Jr., John, Henry, and Roger Wolcott, who were all adults living in 1572.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(2) Thomas Wolcott,"the younger", c.1525-1572, a tucker like his father, was a witness to the will of John Toven of Tolland, dated 1551. The will of Alice Howe of Tolland, dated 1565, mentions her godfather, Thomas Woolcott, and also Henry Woolcott, and has Thomas Woolcott and Thomas Venn as overseers. The will of Thomas Wolcott, tucker, of Tolland, dated and proved in 1572, bequeaths &pound10 to his son, John Wolcott, the elder; an ewe sheep each to his son, Simon, and two unnamed daughters, 4 pence each to several unnamed god-children, and the remainder to his wife Alice. He appoints John Dawe, his brother-in-law, and John Wolcott, his son, as overseers of the will.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(3) John Wolcott, c.1545-1589 Tolland, clothier. As a cloth merchant he probably purchased wool and farmed it out for spinning and weaving. In 1567, John Woolcot leased from Thomas Standish, Rector of Elworthy, a tenement and land in Gauldon manor for a term of the lives of John, Elizabeth his wife, and their son, Henry. Thomas Standish's will dated 1576 was witnessed by Henry Woolcott of Elworthy, and John Woolcott, clothier, and had Henry Woolcott, John Truckwell and Thomas Cross as overseers, "which have married with my brother's two daughters." The 1567 deed is badly damaged, but says that for the sum of four score th...(three shillings?)... Thomas Standysh demises to John Wolcott, Elizabeth, his wife, and son Henry, land in the parish of Tolland in the manor of Gawlden, a tenement of five acres with orchard and garden and seven closes and two meadows or more including Owethye and Overdown closes and Watkins and Frugg Meads, formerly in the occupation of John Sellack, and one close formerly in the possession of John White, deceased, with an annual rent of ten shillings one pence. The land was probably the tucking mill and adjacent lands sublet by John Selleck to John's father. John's children, Richard, Thomas, William,and Joan, were baptised at Brompton Ralph.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">John is mentioned in several other wills. The will of John Seller of Tolland, dated 1572, has John Woolcott and John Dawe as witnesses. Another will of John Seller of Tolland, dated 1581, appoints John Wolcotte the elder and Thomas Dawe of Tolland as overseers, and mentions a debt of 21 shillings owed to Roger Wolcott of Tolland and a debt of 20 shillings owed to widow Wolcott.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">When John wrote his will in 1585, Henry was old enough to act as his father's executor, but the other eight children were all minors. John's will bequeathed &pound422 to his younger children and the remainder to his son, Henry, who he named executor. The custody of John's children, except for Henry, was given to his uncle, Henry Woolcott of Elworthy, Christopher Nation of Bishops Lydiard, and his brother, Simon. Christopher was godfather to John's son, Henry.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(4) Henry Wolcott, 1565-1640 Tolland, the eldest of John's sons, was a prosperous clothier at Tolland, and was executor of his father's will in 1589. He was also executor of the will of his cousin, Thomas Dawe in 1592, and is on the Tolland tax rolls for 1593, 1597, 1610, 1622 and 1623. In 1606 he served as church warden at Tolland, and was tithingman there in 1623 and 1629. A survey of the manor of Brompton Ralph, made in 1615, records that Henry Wolcott held land there by copy of the court rolls dated 1602, for the lives of Henry Wolcott, and Henry and John Wolcott his sons, four fenced meadows, called Rode Meade, Rodemeadehill, Flaxhaye, and Longmeade or Wester Longmeade, containing 10 acres, valued at &pound13 6s 8d per year. No house or tenement is mentioned, so this may have been land for grazing sheep.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">In 1609 Henry leased property in East Town in Tolland from Edward Warre, previously in tenure of George Allenman, for the lives of his sons, Henry, John and George, for &pound248, with annual rent of 24 shillings, with attendance at manor courts at Chipleigh. This was a large amout of money and probably included substantial quantity of land. He terminated this lease in 1624, probably to pass it to his son, Henry, who purchased freehold rights to the same property in 1638. Henry Woolcott attended manor courts at Chipley Manor in 1626 and 1630.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">In 1618 Henry Woolcott acted as an agent for Robert Mynne in the sale of land in Gauldon Manor to Christopher Woolcott of Wellington. He was apparently the Henry listed on the manor roll as "Henry Woolcote for one cottage in length 80 ft. and in breadt 80 ft. upon the waste of the lord of Tolland in the King's Highway there called the Church House next the rectory there, formerly of Robert Selleck and the late Elizabeth Selleck, by grant of David Selleck". In 1631, a Special Commission of the Exchequer held an investigation at Taunton "in distraint of knighthood". In order to raise money, King James was requiring that all men with lands or goods valued at a certain amount be knighted, for which honor they were required to pay a large sum of money into the Exchequer. Many men tried to avoid this dubious honor. On the list of men examined by this commission appears the name of Henry Woolcot, followed by the notation, "not seized". On a later list, the same name appears, with the notation, "will plead". The first note meant that Henry did not hold land directly from the King, and the second note that he would request removal from the list. Henry successfully avoided this "honor". He married Jane Chilcott about 1625. In 1622 she had received a substantial bequest of 350 pounds from her father, George Chilcott.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(5) Elizabeth Wolcott, b. c.1590, m. David Ingram about 1610, and by him had two daughters, Elizabeth and Joan Ingram. Joan married Daniel Rogers in 1629, causing a series of legal suits between Daniel and the Wolcott family over her money. In 1630, Daniel claimed that Elizabeth Ingram, when single, had personal estate worth &pound400, including lands worth &pound30 per year. She had used Henry Wolcott, Jr., as her man of business, as did her sister, Joan, then wife of Humphrey Cordwent. Evidence was given by Richard Woolcott of Bishops Lydiard, age about 56 years, who stated that he had known Daniel Rogers for about 5 years, Elizabeth Rogers, Henry and George Wolcott, and the Cordwent children from childhood, and Humphrey Cordwent for about 15 years. He did not know what estate Elizabeth had five years ago when she married, but had heard that she was then worth about &pound103 in goods, money and debts owing. In a 1637 Chancery Court hearing, Daniel said Elizabeth had a marriage portion of &pound160, which her brother, Henry, agreed to pay at &pound40 per year. Daniel said he received &pound36, after which Henry refused to pay more. Henry said the money had been placed in trust with his brother George. George Wolcott said that before Elizabeth's Ingram's marriage she had agreed to place &pound100 in trust for her sister's children, and he had put &pound105 in bonds, &pound100 of which was Elizabeth's funds for the children. The court decision in 1637 was that said Rogers had received an estate in a copyhold tenement for her life, and an orchard for a term of years, and the &pound100 should be held by George for the children if they survived to age 21.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(5) Henry Wolcott, Jr., c.1595-1650, is named in a manor roll of 1630: "Henry Woolcott junior of Tolland for one cottage with appurtenances standing by the end of Tonebridge called le Dye House in the tithing of Mullane, formerly of Elizabeth Nichols, by grant of Richard Nicholas. Fine 13s 4d." In 1633, Henry Woolcott and George Woolcott were appointed attorneys to deliver seizin of Grove tenement in Tolland. Henry and his brother, George, were defendants in extensive litigation which took place in 1636 in the Chancery case of Rogers v. Wolcott, following. In 1638 Henry Woolcotte of Tolland, clothier, purchased from Edward Warre of Chipley for &pound165 freehold rights to the tenement in East Tolland in which he was living, together with a cottage occupied by William Drier. It was the same property that his father leased from 1609 to 1624.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">Henry's wife, Joan, is buried under the large stone tomb in the Tolland churchyard. The Tolland parish register for 1637 reads: "7 April - Joan wife of Henry Woolcott the elder buried". She is buried with her eldest son in the tomb which bears the inscription:"The body of John Wolcot 21 Mar 1618 Here also lieth the bodie of Johne Woolcot mother of the saide John Wolcot who deceased the 5th of April 1637." Joan was the daughter of Richard Chilcott of Monksilver, who left her 350 pounds in his 1622 will. Henry Wolcott was an overseer of the 1650 will of Joan's step-brother, Robert Gore. This tomb is next to a similar one on which the inscription has been obliterated, which probably covers Joan's husband, Henry. Henry Wollcot of Tolland, gent., was the overseer of the will of Giles Locke of Nynehead, written in 1644. "Henrie Wollcott" acted as an attorney for Henry Wolcott of New England in 1650.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(6) Henry Wolcott III, c. 1635-1670, apparently never married, and died relatively young leaving a sizeable estate. His will bequeaths to his sister Joan Proctor, his nieces, Ann Gale and Joan Proctor, and his nephews Henry and Robert Proctor &pound200 each; to his cousin Joan, daughter of his uncle George, of Tolland, recently deceased, &pound100; to Mr. Francis Colby, minister of Tolland &pound10; to his godson, Henry Newton ten ewe sheep; to Anne Gardner &pound10; to William Newton, butcher, my tenant, &pound10; to each of my household servants 20 shillings; to each of my covenant ship servants 20 shillings; to George Woolcott of Greenway, &pound5; to Richard and George Woolcott, sons of Richard Woolcott late of Bishops Lydiard &pound5 each; and "all the rest of my goods and chattels, parts of ships and plantations beyound sea, I do give and bequeath unto my brother John Woolcott."
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">Henry's bequest to his cousin Joan Wolcott was the basis of a legal dispute between Henry's brother, John, and Joan's half brother, John Walsh. John Walsh complained that "Henry Woolcott late of Tolland, gentleman, deceased, being in his lifetime possessed of a very great personal and testamentary estate consisting in goods chattels ready money jewels plate vessels household stuffs etc. to the value of &pound4,000 and more left in his will among other legacies and bequests unto one Joan Wolcott his cousin germain, daughter of his uncle George Woolcott of Tolland, late before deceased, the sum of &pound100.... John Woolcott, his brother and executor... did scruple the payment of the aforesaid &pound100 and questioned the validity of the deceased passing the right to her legacy to John Walsh ...."
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(6) Joan Wolcott, 1637-1684, m. Robert Proctor of Taunton. Their children, Ann Proctor Gale, Henry Proctor, and Joan Proctor Thurston, are named in the will of Joan's brother, John Wolcott, dated 1699.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(6) Helen, daughter of Henry and Joan Woolcott, 1637-1638, Tolland.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(6) Infant daughter of Henry Woolcott, 1639-1639 Tolland.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(6) John Wolcott, 1640-1700, Tolland, was the residual heir of his brother, Henry, who died in 1670. A ship mentioned in Henry's will was probably the ship, Adventure, mentioned in a deposition taken in 1682: "About four months since came into this harbor the ship Adventure, Morgan Byneham master, of which John Woollcots of Tolland was part owner and was loaded with wine brandy linen cloth and salt. The salt entered and paid duty at Minehead but the wine brandy and cloth all run and was a considerable parcel for there was not less than thirty men at work between two and three hours delivering the same." Whether or not John Wolcott was a party to this smuggling operation is unknown.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">The will of John Wolcott was proved in 1700. It leaves &pound20 to his kinswoman Frances Procter, widow of Henry Proctor, gent; &pound30 to Henry Proctor, his godson; &pound15 to Frances Proctor; &pound20 to Ann Gale his kinswoman, wife of Thomas Gale, Esq.; &pound20 to Robert Gale his Godson; and &pound10 each to Thomas, Henry, Ann, and Joan Gale; &pound20 to Joan, wife of Edward Thurston Esq., and &pound20 to Joan Thurston, his goddaughter; and to all the other children of Joan and Edward Thurston, &pound60 to be equally divided among them. The will mentions his land called Lambrooke lying in the parish of West Monkton, which would go to John Galhampton when he reached the age of 21, and land in Tolland in the possession of Christian Rossiter which would go to his daughter, Joan, for life after the decease of the said Christian Rossiter and then to John Galhampton. Property called Burts Tenement, and meadow called Watkins Meade and four acres of ground at Tolland he left to Joan Galhampton for life and then to John Galhampton. Certain furniture in his dwelling house he left to Ann and John Galhampton. His cattle, sheep, swine, and grain he left to his daughter, Joan. To his kinsman, Samuel Date, he bequeathed two guineas, and unto such servant maid living with him he left 20 shillings. All other lands and properties he bequeathed to his grandson, John Galhampton, naming Edward Galhampton and John Webber, the elder, of Stogumber as executors.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(7) Joan Wolcott, 1670-1720, married (1) Edward Galhampton of Lydiard St. Lawrence about 1690. Joan and Edward had children, John, Ann, Joan, Mary, and Margaret. Edward Galhampton purchased the house called Gauldon Farm at Tolland in 1699, and died in 1703. His son, John, was deceased in 1720 when his sisters sold Gauldon. Joan, widow of Edward Galhampton, married (2) Benjamin Wolcott of New England at Tolland in 1719. Benjamin was the great-grandson of the Henry Wolcott who emigrated to America in 1630. Benjamin had returned to England attempting to settle a disputed inheiritance of the family's land at Tolland. Henry, the emigrant, had entailed the property to his male heirs. His grandson, Henry Wolcott, having no sons, bequeathed the property in England to his two daughters, Benjamin's cousins, in 1718. Benjamin was not successful in his attempt to claim the family lands, but his visit to England did result in his marriage to Joan Galhampton. By her he had a son, Henry, baptized at Tolland in Nov. 1719, who died in infancy.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(8) Henry Wolcott, 1719-1720, Tolland. In July 1720 his sister, Joan Winter, was granted administration of their mother's estate during the minority of her son, Henry.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(5) John Wolcott, c.1595-1618; buried in a tomb in the Tolland churchyard, d.s.p..
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(5) George Wolcott, 1599-c.1668, was baptized at Tolland in 1599. He was at Tolland on the tax roll of 1642, but later lived at Taunton. In 1640, George Woolcott witnessed a deed of land at Tolland by Henry Standish to to William Doble. In 1647, George Woolcott of Taunton, merchant, was appointed overseer of the will of Robert Matthew alias Proctor of Rushton, Somerset, the husband of his niece, Joan Wolcott. In 1654 George Woolcott of Taunton, gent., was named overseer of the will of his cousin, William Woollcott of Lydiard St. Lawrence.

<div class="descendantDiv">(6) Joan Wolcott, b. c.1630. The will of her cousin, Henry Wolcott, dated 1670, leaves a bequest of &pound100 to "my cozen Joane Woolcott, daughter of my Unckle George Woolcott of Tolland lately deceased". She probably died unmarried.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(5) Joan Wolcott, b. c.1600. Joan married Humphrey Cordwent, and had two children, John and Elizabeth. Joan's older sister, Elizabeth, shortly before her marriage to David Rogers in 1629, gave bond to her brother, George, to place in trust money for her sister's children,"being that their father would leave them little or nothing", with &pound80 for Elizabeht, and &pound20 for John, at age 21.

Joan Sweeting 1596 Bicknoller.John leased the property in Tolland called Greenway from Edward Warre in 1639, to be held for 99 years or the lives of John and his sons, George and Thomas. He attended manor courts at Chipley in 1626 and 1630, so may have leased property from the Warres earlier. John Woolcott of Greenway served as churchwarden of the Tolland parish church in 1640.

George served as tithingman at Tolland in 1631 and was churchwarden there in 1636 and 1662, and appears on the Tolland tax roll of 1664. On the 1641 tax roll he was living at Greenway. In 1654, Edward Warre's daughter, Mary Lottisham, sold the tenement commonly called Greenway, now or late in the possession of "John Woolcott, George Woolcott and Thomas Woolcott, sonnes of the said John Woolcott of Tolland" to John Turberville of Tolland, citing "One lease or grant of the premises made by the sayd Edward Warre unto John Woolcott of Tolland aforesaid for fowerscore and nineteen if he ye sayd John Woolcott, George Woolcott & Thomas Woolcott sonnes of the sayd John Woolcott or either of them soe longe live, bearinge date the first day of December in the twelvvthe yeare of ye raigne late king Charles (1639-40) only excepted & foreprsed." The lease would have expired on the death of George. George Woolcot, yeoman, is listed on the Tolland tax rolls in 1663. The names of both George Wolcott, Sr. and George Wolcott, Jr., appear on the Tolland tax roll of 1664. Only one other Wolcott appears on this tax roll, Joan Wolcott, widow, possibly the widow of George's cousin Henry Wolcott. In 1670, George Woolcott, the elder, of Greenway, was bequeathed &pound5 by Henry Wolcott of Tolland, his cousin's son. In 1678 John Turberville mortgaged properties including a house and land called Greenway, and in 1691 established a trust including a house and 14 acres in the possession of Joan Woolcott, who may have been George's widow. Greenway was probably the property that became East Criddles.

In 1638 Elizabeth and Mary Wolcott, filed a petition to have their uncles, Richard Vayle (or Nayle) of Glaston and Christopher Atkins, mercer, act as guardians of their lands at Glaston. These lands were apparently entailed to the children of John and Mary Wrentmore. Elizabeth Wolcott married David Offley, and later, as a widow, sold the lands at Glaston to Edmund White. In the notebooks of Thomas Lechford, lawyer, of Boston, there is an entry, "Elizabeth and Mary Wolcott, daughters of John Wolcott of Glaston, Somerset, England, appoint their uncles, Richard Vayle and Christopher Atkins of Glaston, attorneys". A note in the margin reads, "Write to Henry Wolcott of Windsor, New England, and Edward Wolcott of Axbridge, Somerset.

Richard moved from Tolland to Bishops Lydiard some time between 1633 and 1636. The Protestation returns for 1641 show Richard Wolcott residing at Bishops Lydiard. In 1652, an investigation was held into a dispute concerning a house at Bishops Lydiard known as "Willcott's tenement" in the tenure of Richard Willcotts, who claimed that he held in right of Magdalen Nation of East Comb, widow. Ownership of the property, worth 15 shillings per year, was declared to have reverted to the Crown, for lack of proof of tenure.

In about 1623, Richard and Hugh Wolcott, sons of Richard Wolcott, deceased, "being then but children", were given a lease of the property, except for the bakehouse and two rooms above it, for 21 years at 3L per year by John Carse of Poughill, Devon. In 1634, the Carses complained that the rent was one year in arrears, the premises going to decay, and the racks broken, so they were claiming forfeiture of the Wolcott's &pound40 bond. Richard Wolcott, fuller, died at Stogumber in 1658.

In her will dated 1723 Dorothy said "I give unto William Woolcott twenty pounds in case he be living with me at the time of my decease to be paid unto him in twelve months after my decease."  William appears to have had some administrative roll such as bailiff or steward, and living quarters at the Dunster Castle, for over 15 years.

</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(3?) Thomas Wolcott, c.1560, although not mentioned in John's will, may have been a younger son.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(4) Henry, son of Thomas Woollcott, d. 1582 Brompton Ralph.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(2) John Wolcott, c.1525-1571. John was another son of Thomas Wolcott the elder. Like his brother, Thomas, he was a miller. There were two mills at Tolland, a tucking mill attached to Gauldon Farm, and a grist mill south of it. John's uncle Thomas ran the former and John's father the latter. John's eldest son, John, born in 1547, said in a deposition that he had lived at Elworthy from infancy until about 1560. John and Thomas' younger's brother, Henry, lived at Elworthy from about 1555. John may have been a miller at Elworthy before moving to Tolland.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">John's name appears with his father, Thomas the elder, in the will of William Howe dated 1551 as owing William for raw cloth. John must have been an adult at that time, so was probably born somewhere around 1525. He married Agnes who apparently died in 1606, for Tolland parish records show that Agnes Woollcot, widow, was buried there on 6 November 1606. The 1572 will of John Woolcot of Tolland, miller, leaves 4 pence to John Howe of Tolland, a kettle and a bullock to his son, John; &pound10 and household items to each of his unmarried daughters, Alice and Mary; a sheep to Agnes Meyn; and the remainder to his wife, Agnes, with his brothers, Henry and Roger Woolcote as overseers.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(3) John Wolcott Jr., c. 1547-1623, was the miller at Tolland. The court books of Taunton Deane record the name of John Wolcott or Wulcott as miller at Tolland from 1585 until 1603, and show that he was elected tithingman for Tolland for 1585. After 1603 the names of Henry Wolcott and John Wolcott alternate as miller until 1636. The mill was part of the property that John's son, Christopher, purchased freehold in 1618. John's other son, John, operated the mill after Henry, emigrated to America in 1630.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">"John Wolcot and Agnes Crosse x Aishe" were married at Lydiard St. Lawrence in 1579. The will of Thomas Crosse of Tolland, husbandman, dated 1583, requests that "his good friend" John Woolcot be one of his overseers. This was probably the Thomas Crosse who married Elizabeth Standish, niece of William Standish who purchased Gauldon Manor. The 1588 will of Francis Crosse of Tolland also has John Woolcott as overseer, and John and Henry Wolcott as witnesses. These men must have been Agnes' relatives, and they were all probably related to Walter Crosse, AB, who was the Tolland parish priest from 1480 to 1517, and John Crosse, AM, who was the Tolland parish priest from 1517 to 1554. John Crosse was replaced as rector at Tolland in 1554 when about one fifth of the parish priests in England were replaced by order of Queen Mary, most of them because they were married. A John Crosse of Tolland left a will dated 1544 which was proved at Taunton, but has since been destroyed. Another member of the Crosse family, William Crosse, was rector at Stawley, a village 5 miles south of Wivilscomb, from 1515 until his death there in 1531. Henry Howe of Stawley, who died in 1528, left a bequest to William Crosse, his curate, and the will was witnessed by John Crosse, parson, probably the rector of Tolland.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">In 1592, John Woollcott of Tolland was executor of the will of Robert Goodgrome of Nettlecombe, his brother-in-law. Robert left 40 shillings to his sister, Avis Denborowe, and 20 shillings to each of her 3 children; 30 shillings to his sister Agnes Cross; 20 shillings to each child of his brother-in-law Thomas Duddridge, 20 shillings each to the 4 children of John Woollcott, and the remainder to John. Another will, that of Walter Washer of Lydiard St. Lawrence, dated September 1592, has John Wolcott as overseer. He is probably the John Woolcott involved in a dispute with the rector of Lydeard St. Lawrence in 1607. Witness testified that John had owned three or four acres in Lydiard St. Lawrence for ten years, which he, his son, and servants and laborers used "for tiling or healing stones to cover houses." He had kept two, three, or four horses or mares " to carry his heling or tyling stones to be sold," sometimes at Tolland and sometimes at Brompton Ralph. In 1612, John Woolcott of Tolland, husbandman, made a deposition on behalf of Robert Sellack of Tolland. He said he had lived at Tolland for about 50 years, and before that at Elworthy since infancy, and that he was born at Tolland and was age 65 or thereabouts (b. c. 1547). His son, John Woollcott, junior, of Tolland, yeoman, also testified, saying he was age 30 of thereabouts and had lived at Tolland since birth.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">John's will, dated and proved in 1623, leaves household items and 5 shillings 8 pence to Hugh, Agnes, and Mary, children of his son, John; 6 shillings 8 pence to each child of his son, Henry; 2 shillings 6 pence to "Symon Wolcott my kinsman now dwelinge wth me"; 2 shillings 6 pence to his servant, Giles More; 7 pence each to Richard Locke and Alexander Shattuck; 12 pence to John Sealey; 2 shillings to Maudlen Engram; and the remainder to his son, John; with Christopher and Henry Woolcot as witnesses.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(4) Henry Wolcott, 1578-1655, was baptized at Lydiard St. Lawrence in 1578. In 1594, Henry's great uncle, Henry Wolcott of Elworthy, clothier, granted a house and land at Holford tithing in the manor of Brompton Ralph to his "nephew", Henry, when he should come of age. This must have been this Henry, for his cousin who was also named Henry was to old to have been a minor in 1594. In 1596, when the elder Henry died, the land was given to John, father of the younger Henry, to hold until his son was 21 years old. Henry must have taken possession of this land in 1599 when he came of age. Beginning in 1603, the name of Henry Wolcott alternates with that of John Wolcott as miller at Tolland, and this continues until 1636. Apparently Henry continued to help his father and brother John operate the Tolland mill. In 1621, Henry Woolcott of Holford and Holford Carsley paid a tax or fee of 40s on property located in the parish of Tolland. This may have been a fine paid for taking over his father's property. On 9 Sept. 1630 a fine was registed in the manor accounts for vacating his property at Holford: "Henry Woolcott for licence to demise at farm and to dwell away from one messuage and one ferling of bondland in the tithing of Holford late of Henry Woolcott... for 16 years. Fine 26s 8d."
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">Henry Wolcott and Elizabeth Saunders were married at Lydiard St. Lawrence in 1607. Elizabeth was the daughter of Thomas Saunders of Lydiard St. Lawrence, and his wife, Anne Blake and was baptized at Lydiard St. Lawrence in 1584. Thomas Saunder's will, dated 1609, leaves, among numerous bequests,10 shillings to his daughter, Elizabeth Wolcott, and 20 shillings to her son John. His sons-in-law, Thomas Wrentmore alias Bond and Henry Wolcott of Ash Priors were named overseers of the will. Thomas' wife, Anne Blake Saunders, was the sister of Elizabeth Blake, wife of Robert Selleck who then lived in the Gauldon Manor house. The court records for the manor of Brompton Ralph say that in 1608 Henry Wolcott recorded a document in which he gave to Elizabeth, his wife, a jointure of 16L for life from a house and land in the tithing of Holford, to be paid after his death. Henry Woolcott and his wife, Elizabeth, were presented at the Diocesan Court in July 1609 for the offence of incontinence. "They weare marryed two yeeres agon and shee was delivered of childe within thirtye weekes after." At his time Henry and Elizabeth are described as residing at Lydiard St. Lawrence. When the hearing was held, in 1609, however, they were living at Ash Priors. They were admonished, and the case was dismissed.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">On 20 March 1630, Henry and Elizabeth, with their sons Henry, Christopher and George, emigrated to America on the ship Mary and John. Apparently the family was motivated by strong Puritan religious beliefs. Henry may have been influenced also by Simon Venn of Lydiard St. Lawrence, who Henry later appointed as overseer of his property he inheirited at Tolland. Simon was a brother of John Venn of London, one of the partners in the Massachusets Bay Company in 1628 and 1629. The Wolcotts settled at Dorchester, Massachusetts where Henry was registered on the first list of freemen dated 19 October 1630. Their two daughters, Anna and Mary, and their younger son, Simon, joined them there sometime after 1631. In 1636 the family moved to Windsor, Connecticut. Henry was one of the first twelve men elected to the lower house of Connecticut's first General Assembly in 1637, and in 1643 he was elected to the Magistrates, the upper house of that assembly where he was a member until his death on 30 May 1665.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(5) John Wolcott, b. 1607 Lydiard St. Lawrence.. John remained in England when his family emigrated to America. A letter to Henry Wolcott, Jr., from his cousin in England dated 1631 says: "Your Brother John continues in his old course of living", whatever that means. Henry Wolcott, John's father, in a deed dated 1642 refers to his second son, Henry, as his oldest son, so John probably died between 1631 and 1642.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(5) Henry Wolcott Jr. 1610-1680. The property at Tolland inherited by Henry Wolcott from his brother, Christopher, was deeded to his son, Henry, in 1642. His will leaves to his son, Henry, "housing and lands at Tolland now or late in the improvement of John Dart, land at Wellington called Longforth, eleven acres of land at Tolland now in the possession of John Wolcott after the termination of the estate that was granted by my uncle Christopher Wolcott unto John Wolcott, Sr., long since deceased." The properties at Tolland were eventually sold in 1787 for &pound850 by the Henry's daughters, Elizabeth Allyn and Sarah Chauncey.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(4) John Wolcott III, c.1580-1653. The family's copyhold property at Tolland was held in the names of "John Wolcott the father, John Wolcott the son, and Christopher Wolcott". John operated the grist mill at Tolland, like his father before him. John must have remarried, as one of his letters to his brother mentions his wife, as does his will dated 1652. John was still operating the mill at Tolland in 1634, but by 1639 had moved to Bishops Lydiard, from where he wrote to his brother, Henry: " it hath pleased the Lord to take to his mersie the soull of our deare brother Christopher Wollcott of Wellington who decesed the 25th of March 1639: in the morninge he died untestat and tharby as I understand that his Land faleth unto yourself or your sonne which maketh me to write unto you to know your minde what you will have done in it I desire your answer as soone as maye be for I am informed that his land falleth unto you and all his prsonall estate falleth unto his wiffe and for my partt I shall have nothinge yeat you knowe deare brother that I have supported him by his breeding and his beinge in Fraunce and by byeing him lande by copie into Tolland Mill living and into John Greenslades living which never cost him a pennie and nowe in requitall of it I shall not have a pennie which greveth the verie harte of me that it should soe fall out for he did promise our father in his death bed that my sonne John Wolcott should be his heare unto Tolland Mill." Elizabeth, wife of John Woolcot, was buried at Tolland in 1629.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">A letter from John's son, Hugh, written in 1642 from Wellington, says, "soe it is we are removed from Venns to Wellington at Micklemas last and my father and mother doth live in the house that was my uncles Chr Wollcott and I and my wife doth live with them." On the Lay Subsidy Roll of 1642, John Wolcott paid a tax of 2s 3d at Wellington. A letter from John, dated 1650, says: "at mickelmas 1649 I left of housekeping and myselfe and wife and Daughter Elizabeth doth rent 2 or three roomes of my sonne Hugh Wollcott in the house my sister did lieve and since that time my sonne did take Longforth of your Trustees...." Another letter from Hugh says: "my father is dead he died the 17th of februr 1652... and for Tolland mill there are som goods wch were my grand fathers and my fathers and now I preceaive by my Cozen Henrie you have noe Intent to Departe wth the Estate: you shall buy such household goods as I have there if you plese for I am loth they should be removed ."
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">John's will, proved in 1653, leaves 10 shillings each to his daughter, Agnes Kist, and her two daughters; household items and the balance unpaid on the marriage portion of &pound45 to his daughter, Mary, wife of Richard Coomer; 10 shillings to his daughter, Elizabeth Roach; his interest in a house occupied by Thomas Mundy to his grandchild, Christopher Woolcott; 50 shillings each to the two daughters of his son, Hugh Woolcott; a brass pot to Alice Woolcott; 5 shillings each to George Bickeham and his two daughters; use of his house and land at Tolland to his wife for life; and the residue to his son, Hugh.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(5) Agnes Wolcott, b. c.1610, and her 2 daughters were mentioned in her father's 1652 will; m. Christopher Kist c.1628.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(5) John Wolcott IV, b. c.1610, was probably about the age of his cousin, Henry, who he refers to in a letter of 1631 as his "unseperable cousin." John may have then gone to sea, for in a letter of 1639 his father says, "my sonne John is not com home from the Indens", probably referring to the Indies. The Lay Subsidy Roll of 1642 lists a "John Woolcott at Mill", paying a tax of 6s 5d at Tolland, which may be this John, for his father was then residing at Bishops Lydiard. When his uncle, Henry Wolcott, deeded the Wolcott lands at Tolland to his son, he described it as land now or late in the possession of John Wolcott, except one estate that the said John Wolcott holds by copy of the Court Roll. John is not mentioned in his father's will in 1652.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(5) Hugh Wolcott, b. c. 1618, was living at Bishops Lydiard in 1641, and moved with his parents to Wellington in 1642. He leased the land called Longforth for 10L per year from his uncle Henry in 1649, and still held it in 1654, at which time he was also paying rent to his cousin Henry for Tolland mill. Hugh still held Longforth in 1670. He was Constable at Wellington in 1654. Their son, Christopher, and two unnamed daughters were born prior to 1652. He married Elizabeth ____, who was referred to as "my cousin" by Mary Greenslade Wolcott in her will of 1644.

<div class="descendantDiv">(5) Elizabeth Wolcott, b.1627 Tolland; m. ____ Roach.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(4) Christopher Wolcott, c.1583-1639, was the godson of his great-uncle, Roger Wolcott of Tolland, who bequeathed Christopher one sheep in his will dated 1592. A deposition taken in 1630 states that Christopher was born at Tolland, was then about 47 years of age, had lived at Wellington for the past 21 years, that is since 1609, and was a mercer, a dealer in textiles. A survey of the manor of Brompton Ralph, taken 3 March 1615, says that John Wolcott, 30, and Christopher Wolcott, 24, held by copy of the court roll dated 1602 three fenced properties called Greenmore, Redpitts, and Redpitts meadow. Christopher was a witness to a will at Wellington in 1614. By 1616 Christopher had acquired sufficient capital to purchase freehold, from Robert Mynne, for &pound220, property consisting of two messuages, one mill, three gardens, three orchards, eight acres of meadow, and seventy-four acres of pasture in Tolland and Lydiard St. Lawrence; land which John Wolcott, the father, John Wolcott, the son, and the said Christopher Wolcott held by copy of the Court Roll, and property held by William Pyke by copy of the court roll, all now or lately part of the Manor of Galdon. Robert Catford , William Selleck, and Edward Webber were witnesses. Christopher purchased another piece of land in 1624 called Nollands, or Rowlands, located in Wellington, for the remainder of a term of 60 years. In 1620, Christopher married Mary Greenslade Partridge, widow. She was one of nine children of John Greenslade of Wellington, who died in 1620. Mary was childless and she and Christopher had no children.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">Christopher served as Constable of Wellington in 1627, resulting in Chancery Proceedings brought against him by Christopher Haddon. Christopher Haddon, yeoman, and Christopher Woolcott, mercer, both of Wellington, were chosen to serve as constables for the borough. Christopher Haddon was the senior, but since Christopher Woolcott was reputed to be a great monied man and was accustomed to handling money, Haddon asked him to take charge of collecting all taxes levied in the year and to make all necessary payments. At the end of the year, Christopher Woolcott was to present an account of his dealings and Haddon was to share the cost of any deficit. Haddon claimed that Christopher Wolcott collected &pound60 and paid out less than that, but gave a false accounting. This caused Haddon's arrest for a debt of &pound30 which Christopher Woolcott claimed was the deficit. Christopher Wolcott replied that he had collected only &pound30 16s 4d and had paid out &pound63 17s, mostly on conducting soldiers.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">Christopher died intestate, in 1639. An Inquisition Post Mortem was taken in 1641. It states that by an indenture taken in 1619, John Greenslade, in consideration of the marriage of his natural daughter Mary Partridge to Christopher Woollcott, enfeeofed to the couple a house and lands at Wellington, and 11 acres of land called Longforth, to be Mary's during her lifetime, with remainder to Christopher Woollcott, his heirs and assigns, forever, to be held by male descent. Christopher also held in his own right field land called Brambles Land at Wellington. In addition, he held in capite, from the King, three messuages and tenements and 80 acres of land, meadow, and pasture, with appurtenances, at Tolland, in the tenure of John Woolcott, Sr., John Woolcott, Jr., and Valentine Date for the duration of their lives. Christopher also held one messuage and garden at Wellington in the tenure of George Spiring for his life; a house, garden and orchard, with free plowed meadow and pasture at Wellington in tenure of Christopher's wife, Mary, for her life; and another house and garden at Wellington called Crooke. Christopher had signed a deed of entail, which provided that the properties at Wellington were all to be his wife's until her death. The document states that Henry Woollcott, Christopher's brother and heir, was 50 years of age and more. After Christophers death, his widow remained at Wellington, where she paid a tax of 10s in the Lay Subsidy of 1642. Her will, dated 1644, leaves bequests to her siblings, and "to my Cosen Elizabeth Wulcot Hugh Wulcotes wife the cupboard and presse in the parlour & the bord & my best Serge petticote." John Wolcott was one of the witnesses.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(2) Henry Wolcott, c.1530-1596. Henry purchased a house and one furlong of land at Holford in 1555, and in 1556 was granted licence to "demise the same at farm for 21 years and dwell away from it." Henry then lived at Elworthy, about three miles northwest of Tolland. He is mentioned in the will of Alice Dawe, together with Thomas Wolcott the younger, in 1565, and is listed on the muster roll for Elworthy in 1569. He was the overseer of the will of his brother, John Wolcott, in 1571, and of Thomas Standish, Rector of Elworthy in 1576. He was also one of the overseers of the will of his nephew, John, son of Thomas Wolcott the younger in 1589, and one of the guardians of John's children. He apparently had no children of his own.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">In 1594, a grant of land was registered in the manor court of Brompton Ralph to "Henry Wullcote, son of John Wullcote, for a piece of bondland 20 ft. long and 10 ft. wide in the tithing of Holford by grant of Henry Wullcote, senior, uncle, to attract after it the rest of the messuage and land of the said Henry, vis. a messuage and ferlong of bondland in the said tithing, herriot a cow, price 33s 3d, on condition that he pays 40L as in the will of the said Henry, senior, and that if the said Henry Wullcote, senior, should die before the said Henry Wullcote, junior, is 21 then the said John Wullcote should have the same until he is aged 21. Fine 12s." The elder Henry died in 1596.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(2) Roger Wolcott, c. 1535-1615; had farm in Tolland Manor later called Balsams. He was on Tolland tax rolls from 1581-1610 and was church warden there in 1599 and 1611. He was an overseer of the will of his brother, John, in 1571, and was named in the will of John Seller of Tolland in 1581. In 1575 a citation was issued against "Andrew Geffries, clerk, rector of Tolland, Roger Wulcotte of the same, John Gibbs, and Thomas Warmowthe of Lydyarde St. Lawrence, and Christofer Foweracres of Bradforde to answer concerning the goods of John Sellacke late of Tolland aforesaid who died intestate at the request of Alice Sellacke alias Gibbs, John Selleck's "natural daughter and heiress". Roger's wife, Alice, was the daughter of John Gibbs alias Hall, husbandman, of Lidiard St. Lawrence. Roger, Alice, and their daughters Marie and Elizabeth, are all mentioned in John Gibbs's will, dated 1579. This indicates that Roger's wife was the "natural" daughter of John Selleck by John Gibbs' wife, Joan Webber. Roger's will dated 1592 and proved in 1615, leaves the "tenements and living where I dwell" to his wife, Alice, and after her death to his daughter, Elizabeth; to Elizabeth certain household effects and &pound40 to his daughter, Mary; 5 shillings to his wife's godson, John Jenkins; 12 pence to each godchild; a sheep to his godson, Christopher Woolcott, his house and the residue of his goods to Alice, his wife, and Elizabeth, his daughter; with Robert Sellack of Tolland, John White of Elworthy, and John Standfast of Tolland as overseers and Richard Wrentmore and John Standfast as witnesses.

<hr class="thick">

<div class="descendantDiv">WOLCOTT FAMILY OF NORTH SOMERSET:
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(1) Richard Wolcott, c.1510-60. Richard Wolcott of Selworthy and his descendants lived in and around Selworthy, a village on the north coast of Somerset, 4 miles west of Minehead, and about 20 miles northwest of Tolland. Little is known about Richard Wolcott except that he was living at Selworthy in 1560, and married Margaret. Richard's will, dated 1560, leaves 8 pence to the church of Selworthy and 8 pence to the poor of Selworthy; 8 pence to his god-son Hugh Bryant, 13 shillings 4 pence to each of his sons, Michael, John, Edward, Robert and William, with the stipulation that if any of them die before they were married their legacy was to be divided among the others; pans, spoons, platters and candle sticks to his daughters, Joan and Alice, after the death of his wife, Margaret; and the rest of his estate to his wife.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">After Richard's death, Margaret apparently married someone named Colley, as she and some of her children used the name "Wolcott alias Colley". Chadwyck-Healey's History of West Somerset tells of a controversy that broke out in 1570 between a John Bowyer and Francis Hawley. This errupted into violence in Horners Wood in the manor of West Luccomb, a mile south of Selworthy. There William Wulcott, Mychell Colley and others, acting on behalf of the Hawleys, routed Boyers men. Another similar combat, based on the same quarrel, occurred in 1572. William Colley alias Wulcott was among the participants, and after the fight had broken up the house of Margaret Colley of East Luccomb was searched. A deposition was also taken from Margaret Colley alias Wulcott of Selworthy, widow, age 60 or thereabouts (b.c.1512), the mother of Michael Colley. Margaret Wolcott is also mentioned in another deposition taken in 1572, given in Somerset & Dorset Notes & Queries. It concerned a controversy between Joan Kympe and Jone Wood. Here she is called Margaret Collie alias Wolcott and Margaret Wolcott alias Colly, widow, age 55 years (born in 1517), of the parish of Elworthie (perhaps this should read Selworthy). The deposition states that she kept Joan Kympe, widow, the complaintant and her kinswoman, in her home.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(2) Michael Wolcott, 1534-. Michael, sometimes known as Michael Colley alias Wolcott, was Richard's living eldest son in 1560, as he was the first named child in his father's will. Michael was involved in the quarrel between John Bowyer and Francis Hawley in 1572. Depositions concerning this quarrel were taken, including one from Mychell Colley alias Wulcott, age 38 (born in 1534) of Buckland, servant of Francis Hawley, lord of the manor of Buckland. Buckland was in the parish of Durston, Somerset. He had no known children.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(2) John Wolcott, c. 1535-1587; sometimes known as John Colley als. Wolcott; m. Christian. John was the second son mentioned in the will of Richard Wolcott of Selworthy, dated 1560. He lived at Wooton Courtney, a village three miles south of Selworthy. In 1562, John Wolcott was a witness to the will of Margaret Ritner of Wooton Courtney. The muster rolls of 1569 shows that John Ulcote of Wooton Courtney was to furnish arms, and that William Wolcott, possibly John's younger brother, was to serve as an archer. In 1581, John Wolcote was on the Subsidy Roll, taxed on land with an annual value of 20s, paying a tax of 16d. A wife or daughter of John Wolcot was buried at Selworthy 1577, but this record is partly illegible. John Wolkot was buried at Wooton Courtney 1587. His will bequeathed to his two sons and to Christian, his wife, one sheep apiece, and the residue to his daughter, Elizabeth, who he made his executrix; m. (1) ____ c.1555; m. (2) Christian ____.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(3) Elizabeth Wolcott, c.1555-. Elizabeth was mentioned in the will of Joan Folentine in 1565. She was the residual heiress of her father in 1585.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(4) Joan, 1580-1581. Parish records for Wooton Courtney show that Joan Wolcott, "notha filia" of Elizabeth Wolcott, was baptized there 1580, and that Joan Wolcott, probably the same child, was buried there 1581.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(3) Thomas Wolcott, c.1560-. Thomas was mentioned in the will of Joan Folentine in 1565 and in his father's will of 1587. Joan Wulkot, widow, buried at Wooton Courtney 1596, may have been his wife.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(4) Thomas Wolcott, c.1585. In 1626, Thomas Wolcott was named overseer of the will of William Leigh of Wooton Courtney. The Protestation Retun of 1641 for Wooton Courtney lists the names of Thomas Woolcott and William Wollcott, and the Lay Subsidy of 1642 lists Thomas and William Wolcott together at Wooton Courtney with property valued at 6s 6d per annum and a tax of 1s. Thomas Woolcott took an inventory of the estate of Mary Worth of Luccomb in 1649.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(5) William Wolcott, 1606-1685. William, son of Thomas Wolcote, was baptized at Wooton Courtney 1606. In 1637 orders were issued to reemburse William Woollcott, watchman for the tithing of Wooton Courtney, for expences incurred in apprehending felons. William Woolcott was the only Wolcott to pay the Hearth Tax at Wooton Courtney in 1664. His will was proved at Taunton in 1685.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(6?) William Woolcott, b. c.1650; was at Avell, Dunster, a village 3 miles east of Wooton Courtney, on the Lay Subsidy of 1642.

</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(6?) Robert Wolcott, b. c. 1620, d. 1694 St. Decumans parish, Williton. The name of Robert Woollcott of St. Decumans, is found on the Protestation Returns of 1641, and Robert Woolcot is mentioned in the will of Thomas Vicary, clerk, of St. Decumans Church, dated 1648. Robert Woollcott is also listed on the tax rolls for Williton in 1670.

Ursula retained two rooms, free access, cooking facilities, fodder for a horse, fuel, and two acres of wheat.

<div class="descendantDiv">DULVERTON:
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">William Wolcott lived at Dulverton, just across the Devonshire border in West Somerset. He is the only other Wolcott known to be in Somerset prior to 1525. His will was copied from records at Wells before they were destroyed in World War II. It reads: "In dei nom Amen the second day of August in the yere of or lorde god mccccc I Willm Wulcote of hole mynde and pfett remembrance make my testament in this wyse ffirst I bequethe my soule to Almyghti god and my body to be buryed in the churchyarde of Dulvton. It. to Saynt Andrew of Wells iiijd and to evy one of my godchildren iiijd. It. to Allhallow a pounde of wax. It. to Saynt erasmus a pounde of wax. Item to Saynt xystopher a pounde of wax. to or ladye in the chapell a pounde of wax. It. to the high crosse iiiis iiijd. The residu of my goods not bequethed I give to my wif Elisabeth and her make my full executx to bestow my goods as it plese her for the welth of my sowle. This being witnesse John Skynnr John Kemplyn (or Rawlyn) wt others." Having several godchildren, yet with no children of his own mentioned in his will, this William seems to have been an older man with no children. His will is said to have been proved in 1530 at the Bishop's Court at Wells, thirty years after it was drawn, which is unusual, as in those days most people made their wills on their deathbeds and wills were normally proved a year or so after the decease.
