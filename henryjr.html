<div class="descendantDiv">(1) Henry Wolcott; m. Elizabeth Saunders.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(2) Hon. Henry Wolcott. Jr., b. 1610 Tolland England, d. 1680 Windsor CT. He came to America with his parents 1630, freeman of Boston 1634, moved to Windsor CT 1636; farmer and merchant, had one of the largest apple orchards in CT, making 500 hogsheads of cider a year; one of the 19 patentees named in the CT Charter of 1662, member CT House of Deputies 1655, 1660, 1661, and House of Magistrates from 1662 until his death; in 1669 the Assembly voted him 300 acres of land for his services; member of the Governor's War Council 1675-6; heir to his father's property in England, he visited there in 1654, 1662, and 1671; m. Sarah Newberry 1641 Windsor CT.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(3) Hon. Henry Wolcott III, b. 1643 Windsor CT, d. 1710 Windsor CT.  He served as a "trooper" in Capt. S. Marshall's Co. during King Philip's War; elected to CT House of Deputies 1686,  was Assistant Constable and for many years Town Clerk of Windsor, on committee to settle boundaries of Windsor in 1710; inherited Wolcott lands in England; m. Abiah Goff 1664 Windsor CT.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(4) Elizabeth Wolcott, b. 1665 Windsor CT, d. 1734 Windsor CT.  She and her sister Sarah inherited from their father lands in Tolland, Lydiard St. Lawrence, and Wellington, in England. An unsuccessful legal dispute over the ownership of the Tolland lands was initiatedin 1713 by their Wolcott relatives, basing their claim on English laws of primogeniture. In 1740, her husband deeded the rents from these properties to her sons. In 1787, her grandson, Henry Allyn, sold the Tolland properties for 850L; m. Col. Matthew Allyn 1686 Windsor CT.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(4) Henry Wolcott IV, b. 1667 Windsor CT, d. y..
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(4) Abiah Wolcott, b. 1669 Windsor CT, d. 1696 Windsor CT, unm..
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(4) Sarah Wolcott, b., d. 1671 Windsor CT.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(4) Henry Wolcott IV, b. 1673 Windsor CT, d. 1697, Windsor CT unm..
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(4) Sarah Wolcott, b. 1676 Windsor CT, d. 1698 Stratford CT; co-heiress to Wolcott lands in England; m. Rev. Charles Chauncy 1698 Fairfield CT.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(4) Hon. Samuel Wolcott, b. 1679 Windsor CT, d. 1709 Windsor CT; graduated from Harvard College in 1698, the  first Wolcott to graduate from college in America; he became the schoolmaster at Windsor, and in 1701 obtained a Masters Degree from Harvard; appointed Capt. of the Windsor militia 1705, elected to the CT General Assembly 1706. Samuel died 4 months after his father and thus was the heir to the Wolcott property in England, which his two sisters, Elizabeth Allyn and Sarah Chauncey later claimed, causing legal disputes with Wolcott relatives over primogenerative laws. There seems to have been no question of any other possible heir, so no legal offsprings of Samuel.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(5?) Samuel Wolcott, b. c. 1703, d. c.1773. Based on DNA test results, and chronological and geographical evidence, it is probable that he was fathered out of wedlock by a grandson of Henry Wolcott III or his brother John. Samuel, above, seems the likeliest possibilitiy, being single, age 24, and in Boston shortly before this birth. There is no records of his baptism in Connecticut or Massachusetts where baptismal records for this period are very complete. However, there was a Samuel, son of Samuel Allyn, baptized at Windsor in 1703.  The only Samuel Allyn at Windsor at this time was born in 1667 and was brother-in-law to Elizabeth Wolcott, Samuel Wolcott's sister. There is no record of Samuel Allyn's marriage or death. It is probable that Elizabeth Wolcott Allyn, had Samuel Wolcott's out-of-wedlock son baptised at Windsor as Samuel Allyn, presumed son of her brother-in-law, Samuel Allyn.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">Samuel Wolcott of Charlestown appears to have not questioned his being a Wolcott, using that name when he married in 1725 and on the Charlestown tax rolls from 1729 to 1737. Samuel Wolcott filed intention to marry Bridget Hay at Boston in 1722, but Bridget married another man in 1727 in Boston, still using her maiden name. Samuel was "of Boston" in 1725 when he married Mary "Mercy" Fosdick at Charlestown, who claimed a loss of 200 pounds when the British burned Charlestown in 1775, 2 years after Samuel's death.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">In a court case dated 1732, Robert Ball of Charlestown, mariner v. Samuel Wilcot, now or late resident of Charlestown, mariner, Ball claimed that in 1729 he had loaned Samuel money 3 pounds 11 shillings that was not repaid. The court found for the plaintiff and Samuel was ordered to pay 33s and court costs. On the reverse of this document is found "Attest 1 Oct. 1732 xxx Samuel Wolcott" and a notation that a bond was given by the defendant, Samuel Wolcutt, sailmaker, of Charlestown, who pled that he had made payment. He had as surety Stephen Ford, blockmaker, of Charlestown. A deposition in this case reads: "Thomas Robenson Mariner of Lawful age Testifieth & Saith that on or about the Year 1729 he the deponent did belong and was Shiped on boord the Sloop Medford whereof Robert Ball was Master in which time this deponent saw Saml Wilcot under the custody of Mr. Joshua Scottow deputy Sherif and that he the said Ball Paid money to release the said Wilcot from going to Gaol the said Wilcot then promising to come to work on board the said Sloop to proceed on a voyage in the said Sloop with him the said Ball and further this deponent saith that the said Saml Willcot came two or three peices of Days and in that space of time went from the said vessel several times as if he did not incline to work and then wholly absented himself and came no more and by what this deponent could learn while the said Wilcot was on board that the said Robert Ball had lent him the said Wilcot more money at sundry other times beside what he paid the Sheriff for his discharge. Samuel Wolcott of Boston m. Mary "Mercy" Fosdick of Charleston 1725 at Charlestown. "Widow Mary Willcott" was living in Charlestown in 1775.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(6) Samuel Wolcott Jr., b. 1727 Charleston MA, d. 1809 Cheshire MA; married Lucy Wright 1750 at Wethersfield CT. In 1751 Lucy's mother, Abigaill Goodrich Wright, sold land at Wethersfield to "my son-in-law Samuel Wolcott ye 2nd of said Wethersfield". The following day Samuel sold the land to Samuel Wolcott, Sr., of Wethersfield (1713-1800) According to Stiles History of Weathersfield, Joseph Webb bought a house and 2 3/4 acres of land at Wethersfield from Maj. Samuel Wolcott in 1752. In the following year he bought from Samuel Wolcott, then of Goshen, Connecticut two and three quarters acres more adjoining for 1,374 pounds, and also a similar quantity of land from Lt. Timothy Wright, the uncle of Lucy. Samuel moved from Lanesboro, Berkshire Co. Massachusetts, to Goshen, CT, about 1753. Lucy Wright may have gone to Goshen CT with her mother, who moved there about 1740.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">It is said that Samuel and 12 or 14 other men from Worcester County, Massachusetts, came to Shoreham, Vermont, about 1766 and built a log house in which they lived together as one family, taking turns in housework and cooking and working together at clearing and improving the land which they had jointly purchased. He moved his family to Shoreham, VT, by 1773. Apple trees he planted in 1774 became a nursery, furnishing fruit and trees to the neighborhood. He and his son, Samuel, were privates with Ethan Allen's "Green Mountain Boys", who captured Fort Ticonderoga in 1775. The Wolcott family moved for safety to Cheshire, Massachusetts during the war, and then returned to Shoreham.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">An account of the early residents of Shoreham, written by Rev. Josiah Goodhue in 1861 says of him: "In the fall of 1773, Samuel Wolcott from Goshen, Connecticut, settled with his family on the farm now owned and occupied by Deacon Almon Wolcott. He and his son, Samuel, were with Ethan Allen's party at the capture of the fort. Becoming alarmed by a party of Indians that appeared in the vicinity, he and his family fled to Berkshire County, Massachusetts, where they remained until 1783. Then they returned to the farm they had left. He died while on a visit to friends in Massachusetts." "The History of Cheshire" says "Samuel Wolcott Jr. settled on land adjoining the Cream Hill Stock Farm on the south soon after the Revolution and died there." In 1790 his family at Shoreham consisted of 2 males over 16 and 1 female. Samuel died of smallpox while visiting his son, Moses, at Cheshire. In a deed dated 1804, "Jese Wallcutt, Alven Wolcott, & Philemon Wallcutt of Shoreham Vermont, heirs of Samuel Wollcut of said Shoreham deceased, son of Mercy Wallcut formerly of Charlestown, widow, decst.", conveyed rights to land at Charlestown; m. Lucy Wright 1750 Wethersfield CT.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">Samuel is said to have come to Shoreham in 1766 without his family, but had 4 kids before he moved his family to Shoreham in 1773. No record has been found of Wolcott births at Goshen and no children of Samuel and Lucy were recorded at Wethersfield.

It was said of him: "But the want of steady aim and of self command was fatal to the hopes cherished for him. But for an unfortunate habit into which he was early drawn he might have risen to a position of eminence in political or private life or in the practice of his profession. His career was short and its termination a melancholy one", perhaps indicating alchololism; m. Nancy McCauly c.1820 Shoreham VT.
