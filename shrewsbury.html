<div class="descendantDiv">The fifth Wolcott family to come to America was that of Samuel Wolcott of Shrewsbury NJ, who emigrated to America in 1660. He was probably the Samuel, son of Samuel Wolcott, who was bapt. at Plymouth, Devonshire, in 1630, the same year that Henry Wolcott, the immigrant left that port en route to America The elder Samuel m. Charity Bake 1627 at Plymouth, and had Phillip, b. 1628, Samuel b. 1630, and Hannah b. 1632. He signed the 1641 Protestation Return at Plymouth. This is the only Samuel of the right age known to have been in England.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">The current Wolcott/Walcott DNA project shows that Samuel was related to the Tolland Wolcotts, but with a SNP difference. This suggests that he probably descendant from a branch of the Somerset Wolcotts other than the Tolland Wolcotts, possibly the Wolcotts of Wiveliscombe. Four DNA Project participants are descendants of Peter Wolcott, believed to be Samuel's son.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">Considerable research on this family was done by Michael Raymond Wolcott of Brooklyn NY.

<div class="descendantDiv">
(1) Samuel Wolcott, b c.1630, d. 1687 Tinton Falls NJ; arrived in America in 1660 as an indentured servant of John Templeton, mariner. Most indentures for passage to America were for four years, at the conclusion of which Samuel would have been at liberty to settle wherever he wished. In 1664, the year in which Samuel's indenture would have been completed, the Dutch surrendered New Amsterdam to the British and the colony of New York was established. This was divided in 1665, and New Jersey was established as a separate colony. In 1676, the New Jersey colony was divided into East Jersey, which included Shrewsbury, and West Jersey, which given to the Quakers. In 1677, a warrant for survey of lands in East Jersey included the name of Samuel Wilcott, so he had settled there by that date. A land grant document dated 1688 refers to "Saml Willcott of Shroesbury for 160 acres there bounded E. by Stephen Williams, N. by Neversinks River, W. by unsurveyed land, S. by Col. Morris formerly Saml Leonard; 2 acres of meadow bounded S.W. by John Hanse, S.E. by the head of small creek, N.E. by Edmonds Lafetera, N.W. by uplands; 4 acres meadow on Raccoon Island bounded S.W. by Gideon Freebourne, N.W. by river, N.E. by unsurveyed meadow, S.E. by Shroesbury River." This land must have been acquired by Samuel earlier, as the document is dated after his death.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">Samuel's will, dated and proved 1687, bequeaths unto his "sons" Edward Williams and Nathaniel Wolcott all his lands and goods to be equally divided between them and provides that Edward be reembursed for money he paid out for Samuel and for his land. Because Edward Williams is referred to as Samuel's son, it has been assumed that Samuel married a widow named Williams and that Edward was his step-son. In is equally likely that Edward may have been Samuel's son-in-law. Edward's wife was named Mary, but her surname is unknown. A Mary Wolcott, daughter of Samuel and Agnes Wolcott was bapt. 1646 at Wiveliscombe, Somerset, but probably unrelated.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">Samuel may have been the father of Peter Wolcott, who was living as a Quaker at Burlington in West Jersey in 1686. Peter was not mentioned in Samuel's will, and there is no indication that Samuel was a Quaker, so Samuel may have disowned Peter because of Peter's religious beliefs. The relationship of Peter to Samuel is uncertain.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(2) Nathaniel Wolcott, b. c.1670, d. 1691 Shrewsbury NJ. The will of his father, Samuel, dated 1687, provides that Judah Allen and Thomas Webley be his executors, and asks that they "take that my son Nathaniel be no wise wronged by his master Joseph Grover." This indicates that Nathaniel was at that time apprenticed to Grover, and therefore in his teens. In 1690 Nathaniel Woollcott of Shrewsbury, carpenter, sold to Edward Williams his one half share in land formerly in the possession of Samuel Woollcott for &pound14. Nathaniel died intestate. Letters of administration of his estate were granted to Edward Williams of Shrewsbury in 1692. Benjamin and Peter Wolcott, sometimes said to have been Nathaniel's children, were sons of Peter Wolcott of Burlington. Nathaniel is said to have also had a son, Henry, but there has been no evidence found to support this, nor any evidence that Nathaniel ever married. Nathaniel was probably about 21 years old when he died.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(2?) Peter Wolcott, b. c.1670, d. 1690 Burlington NJ. Peter was about 18 when Samuel Wolcott died. He apparently moved to West Jersey, which had been given to the Quakers a few years earlier. He is not mentioned in Samuel's will, possibly because he was disowned for becoming a Quaker. There is no indication that Samuel or his son, Nathaniel, were Quakers. In 1685, the Burlington Society of Friends records show that "Peter Woolcott is willing to make graves and to look at ye fences of ye burying ground." At this time he was also hired to open and close the Friends meeting hall. The records also show that in 1686 Thomas Budd and others were requested to take care of Peter Wolcott and his wife, "being poor." This may have meant that he was in poor health. Peter Woolcott served on a jury at Burlington in 1688. His widow, Joan Wolcott, was a witness to births at Burlington in 1691 and 1693. Jone Woolcott of Burlington m. William Worth of Shrewsbury in 1695 at the Burlington Friends' meeting house. William Worth died at Shrewsbury in 1711, and Joan died at Shrewsbury in 1720.
</div>

</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(3) Benjamin, son of Peter and Joan Woolcott, b. 1687 Burlington NJ, d. c.1750 Shrewsbury. His birth was recorded at the Burlington Friends Society. Benjamin declared himself a Quaker in 1704, requesting exemption from military service in the Burlington militia. Benjamin and his wife, Meribah gave permission for their daughter, Susannah, to marry in 1743. Benjamin is probably the ancestor of all the following NJ Wolcotts.

The will of Hugh Jackson of Shrewsbury, dated 1760, names his "brothers", William Jackson and Benjamin Willcot as executors; Benjamin Wilcott paid tax at Shrewsbury 1779-1790.
