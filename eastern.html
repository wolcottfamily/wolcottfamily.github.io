<div class="descendantDiv">The Wolcott/Walcott/Wilcott DNA project has found that descendants of Emmanuel Walcott of Buckinghamshire (c.1570-c.1650) and Thomas Walcot of Hampshire (c.1680-1722) share somewhat similar DNA. There is also some similarity between these two Walcott participants and the descendants of William Walcott who immigrated to Salem MA in 1638. All show a Nordic origin, unlike the Walcots of Shropshire and Wolcotts of Devon who have Celtic DNA, and Somerset Wolcotts who have Anglo-Saxon genetic origins. The matches are not close enough to assume a common ancestor, nor far enough apart to preclude one. Additional participants from English Walcott families are encouraged to participate in the DNA project to confirm and expand the knowlege of these families' relationships. For more information about the DNA project, return to the index and go to the DNA project web page.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">The Walcotts of Eastern England probably descend from Danish invaders that settled in Eastern England in the 10th century. They took their surname from one or more of several settlements named Walcott. Walcot in the counties of Lincolnshire and Wiltshire, Walcott in Norfolk, and Walcote in Leicestershire and Warwickshireshire, were all listed in the 11th century Domesday records.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">The Walcotes of Norfolk, the de Walcotes of Lincolnshire, and the Walcotes of Leicestershire, all seem to have died out in the male lines. Lincolnshire Walcots seem to disappear in the 17th century.

<div class="descendantDiv">I. WALCOTES OF NORFOLK:
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">This family used "de Walcote" as a surname, is derived from the village of Walcott, part of the manor of Little Snoring, located near the ocean on the north coast of Norfolk. In 1199 Thomas de Walcot was living at Walcot, but it is not known if he was related to the following Walcotes. Their coat-of-arms, an inescutcheon within an orle of martlets, is recorded in the Norfolk and Suffolk Roll of Arms, c.1400. As far as we have been able to find, the de Walcotes of Norfolk died out about 1400 and have no known descendants.

<div class="descendantDiv">II. WALCOTES OF YORKSHIRE:
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">This family used "de Walcote" as a surname, but any connection to a Walcott place name is unknown. Information about this family is from the History of Barwick-in-Elmet, published by the Thoresby Society, various internet sources, and the records of John B. Wolcott. This family seems to have died out in the 1300s.
</div>

</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(2) William de Walcote, b. c.1200; William received part of the lands of his brother, Robert.

<div class="descendantDiv">III. THE WALCOTES OF WALCOTE, LEICESTERSHIRE
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">This family derives its surname from the village of Walcote in the parish of Misterton, Leicestershire, located near the town of Luttersworth, near the Warwickshire and Northamptonshire borders. Walcote is listed in the Domesday Book as four carucates of land subject to Danegeld. It was held from the Crown by the Verdun family of Alveton, Staffordshire from c.1100 to 1316.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(1) Richard de Walecote, c.1220; witnessed a deed at Misterton in 1263.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(2?) William de Walcote, c.1245.

William de Walcote in Lutterworth and others witnessed a deed conveyng land at Pulteney, Leicestershire, to John Owyn. Pultney is in Misterton, adjascent to Walcote.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(2) Robert de Walcote. c.1245-. In 1276 Robert de Walcote held 2 virgates, approx. 50 acres, in Walcote. Robert de Walcote, or perhaps his son, was paid 3 shillings from the account of the mayor of Leicester in 1300.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(3) Richard de Walcote, MP, c.1270-c.1350. Richard de Walcote was paid 6 shillings from the account of the mayor of Leicester in 1300.

He was mentioned numerous times as taxpayer, auditor, burgess, member of the merchant's guild, and juror at Leicester, 1324-1346. He represented the city of Leicester in the parliaments of 1339, 1340, and 1346. Richard de Walcote was at Lutterworth in 1348.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(3) Ralph de Walcote, MP, c.1280-1318, draper and cloth merchant; admitted freeman of London 1310, elected to represent London at the parliament held at Lincoln in 1310.

His will proved at London 1318 conveyed a house and land in St. Lawrence Candlewick Street, London, to Robert Lovett of Liscombe, Buckinghamshire, and Thomas his son, and to son John 20 pounds to be given to a charity if John died before age 21. His executor, John Priour, petitioned the Crown for 87 pounds, a debt owed him for cloth supplied to the Royal Wardrobe.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">NOTE: Robert Lovett acquired Liscombe Manor in the parish of Soulbury, Buckinghamshire by marriage to Sarah de Turville in 1304. He must have been a relative or close family friend because Richard de Walcote of Luttersworth witnessed a deed for him in 1309, he appointed Hugh de Walcote as rector of Soulbury in 1313, and he was the primary legatee in 1318 of the will of Ralph de Walcote, above, probably as trustee for Ralph's son.

Most mercer apprenticeships began at age 16 and lasted about 10 years, so this one probably ended about 1360. In a will dated 1361 John Walcote was the principal heir of John Boteler, draper, who left to John de Walcote various household goods, a brewery called " le Dragon" in Douuegate, parish of S. Mary de Bothawe ; a tenement called "le Catfethell " in the parish of S. Benedict Shorhogg, and another tenement opposite the church of S. Pancras.

A hearing regarding a tenement in All Hallows Breadstreet parish said that he left the property to his wife Christina for life and then to be sold. The widow with Bertram Walcote and Thomas Bricet, the other executors deeded land in 1412 to Walter Gawtron and his wife, Joan, John's former ward but sometimes described as his daughter. Joan married Walter King, a London grocerr, and (2) Walter Gawtron, MP. An Act of Parliament in 1447 authorized the distribution of his chaitable bequests valued at 7,000 marks in the hands of the Executors of Walcote.

<div class="descendantDiv">(4) Nicholas de Walcote, c.1300-c.1370. Nicholas de Walcote, Thomas de Walcote and others of Worcestershire, were pardoned in 1328 for fines imposed in them by King Edward II.

</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">Froissant's Chronicles records that in 1380, "messire Jean Wallecok" and several other men were knighted on the field before the walls of Troyes, by Thomas of Woodstock, Earl of Buckingham, commander of the English army. The Surrey Roll of Arms dating from shortly after 1380, lists the arms of Sir John de Walcote: on a cross patonce azure 5 fleur-de-lis or, five gold fleur de lis on a blue cross with divided ends. Thomas of Woodstock was the leader of powerful nobles whose ambition to wrest power from Thomas' nephew, King Richard II of England, culminated in a successful rebellion in 1388, which significantly weakened the king's power. Richard II managed to overcome these lords in 1397, and Thomas of Woodstock was imprisoned in Calais to await trial for treason. These events affected John de Walcott. In a 1389, petition of John Walcote knight put in exigents (for immediate attention) in Leicestershire. In 1390 Sir John Walcott was sent to the Tower of London. He was later transferred to the Marshalsea Prison for 3 more years. The Tower was generally reserved for political prisoners, so John must have followed Thomas of Woodstock's opposition to King Richard II. In 1399, Thomas of Woodstock's brother, Henry, deposed Richard II and assumed the crown as Henry IV.

In 1340 Thomas de Quenton of Newport filed a claim against Philip de Walcote and Alice his wife regarding these lands, saying the John de Quentyn had granted him 4 marks rent for life from these lands. In the hearing it was said that John Quentyn owed money to William Sparks who was given the land until the debt was repaid and William granted it to Thomas de Quentyn and Philip de Walcote, and John de Quentyn then granted his right to the land to Philip de Walcote and his then wife, Eleanore.

<div class="descendantDiv">The Wolcott/Walcott/Wilcott DNA project has found that descendants of Emmanuel Walcott of Buckinghamshire (c.1570-c.1650) and Thomas Walcot of Hampshire (c.1680-1722) share somewhat similar DNA. There is also some similarity between these two Walcott participants and the descendants of William Walcott who immigrated to Salem MA in 1638. All show a Nordic origin, unlike the Walcots of Shropshire and Wolcotts of Devon who have Celtic DNA, and Somerset Wolcotts who have Anglo-Saxon genetic origins. The matches are not close enough to assume a common ancestor, nor far enough apart to preclude one. Additional participants from English Walcott families are encouraged to participate in the DNA project to confirm and expand the knowlege of these families' relationships. For more information about the DNA project, return to the index and go to the DNA project web page.

<div class="descendantDiv">The Walcotts of Eastern England probably descend from Danish invaders that settled in Eastern England in the 10th century. They took their surname from one or more of several settlements named Walcott. Walcot in the counties of Lincolnshire and Wiltshire, Walcott in Norfolk, and Walcote in Leicestershire and Warwickshireshire, were all listed in the 11th century Domesday records.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">The Walcotes of Norfolk, the de Walcotes of Lincolnshire, and the Walcotes of Leicestershire, all seem to have died out in the male lines. Lincolnshire Walcots seem to disappear in the 17th century.

<div class="descendantDiv">This family used "de Walcote" as a surname, is derived from the village of Walcott, part of the manor of Little Snoring, located near the ocean on the north coast of Norfolk.

Their coat-of-arms, an inescutcheon within an orle of martlets, is recorded in the Norfolk and Suffolk Roll of Arms, c.1400. As far as we have been able to find, the de Walcotes of Norfolk died out about 1400 and have no known descendants.

<div class="descendantDiv">II. WALCOTES OF YORKSHIRE:
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">This family used "de Walcote" as a surname, but any connection to a Walcott place name is unknown. Information about this family is from the History of Barwick-in-Elmet, published by the Thoresby Society, various internet sources, and the records of John B. Wolcott. This family seems to have died out in the 1300s.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(1) Robert de Walcote, b. c.1180, is the first Yorkshire Walcote for which there is documentary evidence. About 1240 Robert de Walcote was granted property at Lasingcroft and Shippen, in the manor of Scholes, Yorkshire, by Roger de Quincy (c.1195-1264), Earl of Winchester. This grant was again confirmed in 1253 when Roger granted to his kinsman, Edmund de Lacy, the Manor of Kippax and Scholes, provided that previous grants to John de Lungvilers and Robert de Walcote be ratified. Scholes was deeded to the Lacy family. Robert de Walcote granted the majority of the property to his nephew, Robert de Walcote, son of his brother, John de Walcote. A portion of the land was given to his brother, Richard; m. Eva ____. Roger is sometimes said to be a son of Richard de Walcote of Leicester, with no know evidence to support this.

<div class="descendantDiv">III. THE WALCOTES OF WALCOTE, LEICESTERSHIRE
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">This family derives its surname from the village of Walcote in the parish of Misterton, Leicestershire, located near the town of Luttersworth, near the Warwickshire and Northamptonshire borders. Walcote is listed in the Domesday Book as four carucates of land subject to Danegeld. It was held from the Crown by the Verdun family of Alveton, Staffordshire from c.1100 to 1316.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(1) Richard de Walecote, c.1220; witnessed a deed at Misterton in 1263.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(2?) William de Walcote, c.1245.

William de Walcote in Lutterworth and others witnessed a deed conveyng land at Pulteney, Leicestershire, to John Owyn. Pultney is in Misterton, adjascent to Walcote.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(2) Robert de Walcote. c.1245-. In 1276 Robert de Walcote held 2 virgates, approx. 50 acres, in Walcote. Robert de Walcote, or perhaps his son, was paid 3 shillings from the account of the mayor of Leicester in 1300.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(3) Richard de Walcote, MP, c.1270-c.1350. Richard de Walcote was paid 6 shillings from the account of the mayor of Leicester in 1300.

In 1324 Richard de Walcote was appointed auditor of the accounts of the mayor of Worcester. He was mentioned numerous times as taxpayer, auditor, burgess, member of the merchant's guild, and juror at Leicester, 1324-1346. He represented the city of Leicester in the parliaments of 1339, 1340, and 1346. Richard de Walcote was at Lutterworth in 1348.

His executor, John Priour, petitioned the Crown for 87 pounds, a debt owed him for cloth supplied to the Royal Wardrobe.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">NOTE: Robert Lovett acquired Liscombe Manor in the parish of Soulbury, Buckinghamshire by marriage to Sarah de Turville in 1304. He must have been a relative or close family friend because Richard de Walcote of Luttersworth witnessed a deed for him in 1309, he appointed Hugh de Walcote as rector of Soulbury in 1313, and he was the primary legatee in 1318 of the will of Ralph de Walcote, above, probably as trustee for Ralph's son.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">NOTE: Sir John de Poulteney, born 1300 in Misterton, Bucks., left Misterton for London where he became a succesful draper and cloth merchant. He is mentioned as a citizen of London in 1322. Poultney is adjascent to Walcote in the parish of Misterton. John was elected four times Lord Mayor of London, 1330-6, and knighted in 1337. In his will of 1349 he established a chantry chapel in the church of St. Lawrence Candlewick Street where a daily mass was to be said for the souls of him and his family and for his mother-in-law, and Ralphe de Walcote, and the archbishop of Canterbury.

</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(4? ) John de Walcote, c.1300, mentioned in above 1318 will of Ralph de Walcote as under age 21. In an undated deed John son of Ralph de Walcote sold to Hugh Scott 2 1/2 acres in the field of Southorpe in Barnack, Northants., on the road to Sutton.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(5) John Walcott, b. c.1334; merchant and draper, Lord Mayor of London. John Walkot was apprenticed to Thomas Chalkton, mercer, of London, in 1350. Most mercer apprenticeships began at age 16 and lasted about 10 years, so this one probably ended about 1360. In a will dated 1361 John Walcote was the principal heir of John Boteler, draper, who left to John de Walcote various household goods, a brewery called " le Dragon" in Douuegate, parish of S. Mary de Bothawe ; a tenement called "le Catfethell " in the parish of S. Benedict Shorhogg, and another tenement opposite the church of S. Pancras.

A hearing regarding a tenement in All Hallows Breadstreet parish said that he left the property to his wife Christina for life and then to be sold. The widow with Bertram Walcote and Thomas Bricet, the other executors deeded land in 1412 to Walter Gawtron and his wife, Joan, John's former ward but sometimes described as his daughter. Joan married Walter King, a London grocerr, and (2) Walter Gawtron, MP. An Act of Parliament in 1447 authorized the distribution of his chaitable bequests valued at 7,000 marks in the hands of the Executors of Walcote.

His brother, Henry, was restored to those titles in 1324, and was a supporter of Queen Isabella (1295-1358). He helped capture Edward II and was his custodian until his execution in 1327. Henry was then appointed guardian of Isabella's son, Edward III. In 1329 the sheriff was ordered to restore lands, goods and chattels taken from Geoffrey de Walcott of Leicester for tresspass, excess, or disobedience, and in that year Geoffrey de Walcote, yeoman, accompanied Henry, Earl of Leicester and Lancastershire overseas. In 1348, William de Wykyngston, parson of Lutterworth, complained that William, son of Geoffrey de Walcote of Lutterworth, Nicholas and Richard his brothers, Agnes late wife of Geoffrey de Walcote, and others, broke into his house at Lutterworth, assaulted his men, and carried off his goods.

</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(4) Nicholas de Walcote, c.1300-c.1370. Nicholas de Walcote, Thomas de Walcote and others of Worcestershire, were pardoned in 1328 for fines imposed in them by King Edward II.

</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">Froissant's Chronicles records that in 1380, "messire Jean Wallecok" and several other men were knighted on the field before the walls of Troyes, by Thomas of Woodstock, Earl of Buckingham, commander of the English army. The Surrey Roll of Arms dating from shortly after 1380, lists the arms of Sir John de Walcote: on a cross patonce azure 5 fleur-de-lis or, five gold fleur de lis on a blue cross with divided ends. Thomas of Woodstock was the leader of powerful nobles whose ambition to wrest power from Thomas' nephew, King Richard II of England, culminated in a successful rebellion in 1388, which significantly weakened the king's power. Richard II managed to overcome these lords in 1397, and Thomas of Woodstock was imprisoned in Calais to await trial for treason. These events affected John de Walcott. In a 1389, petition of John Walcote knight put in exigents (for immediate attention) in Leicestershire. In 1390 Sir John Walcott was sent to the Tower of London. He was later transferred to the Marshalsea Prison for 3 more years. The Tower was generally reserved for political prisoners, so John must have followed Thomas of Woodstock's opposition to King Richard II. In 1399, Thomas of Woodstock's brother, Henry, deposed Richard II and assumed the crown as Henry IV.

In 1340 Thomas de Quenton of Newport filed a claim against Philip de Walcote and Alice his wife regarding these lands, saying the John de Quentyn had granted him 4 marks rent for life from these lands. In the hearing it was said that John Quentyn owed money to William Sparks who was given the land until the debt was repaid and William granted it to Thomas de Quentyn and Philip de Walcote, and John de Quentyn then granted his right to the land to Philip de Walcote and his then wife, Eleanore. In 1347 Roger de Costynoble deeded to Robert de Norwich lands held by Philip de Walcote and Alice his wife in Fulham, Brainford, and Yilling, and Thomas de Walcote, son of Philip de Walcote, put in his claim to them.
