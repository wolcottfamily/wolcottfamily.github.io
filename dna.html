<div class="descendantDiv">The Wolcott/Woolcott/Walcott/Walcutt/Wilcott/Woollacott DNA project was begun by Charles W. Wolcott and John B. Wolcott in 2004. The purpose was to establish DNA base data for these families, to attempt to identify common ancestors, to ascertain how their DNA mutated, and to help Wolcotts, Woolcotts, Walcotts, Wilcotts, Woollacotts, etc. find or verify their patrilineal descent. We also hoped to prove or disprove some relationships that had previously been conjectural.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">The Wolcott/Woolcott/Walcott DNA program uses the Family Tree DNA testing program, which has the largest DNA data base in the world. We are testing for the Y chromosome, which has the biological feature of being passed from father-to-son, much like a surname, without any contribution or mixing from the mother. In this way, men who share a common patrilineal ancestor can be matched by their shared Y-chromosome, even if separated by many generations and hundreds of years. Over time, the Y-chromosome accumulates minor mutations, which then are passed to subsequent generations, showing branches from the original paternal source. For this reason, only males in a direct Wolcott/Woolcott/Walcott line can participate in our project. Several women have obtained DNA samples from male relatives for testing. There is a charge by the laboratory to process your DNA sample, but no other cost for participating in this all-volunteer effort run entirely by participants in the project.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">Our Y-DNA tests allow us to place our participants in specific officially recognized "haplogroups", groups descended from a common ancestor. These haplogroups divide into other sub-groups as common mutations are identified. These become branches and twigs on the human family tree.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">ANGLO-SAXON WOLCOTTS - Haplotype Y19922 (c.1425AD)
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">A majority of our participants are members of the Wolcott Family Society and descendants of Thomas Woolcott of Tolland, Somerset, b. c.1500. Wolcott has become the chosen spelling of this family in America, whereas Woolcott was and remains the favored spelling in England. Four separate groups of descendants of Thomas Woolcott have been identified by their DNA as individual branches of Thomas' descendants.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">Shortly into our project we found that there were two particular markers that were different in the 26 descendants of Henry Wolcott, 1579-1655, who immigrated from Tolland, Somerset, to Connecticut in 1630, and a majority of the 21 descendants of his second cousin, John Wolcott, 1599-1638, who immigrated from Axbridge, Somerset, to Massachusetts in 1634. Differentiating the two branches has allowed us to identify and correct some descents.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">Four descendants of Samuel Wolcott, c.1703-1773, who married Mercy Fosdick at Boston MA in 1725, carry Y-DNA similar to descendants of Henry Wolcott. Samuel is now thought to have been born out of wedlock to a grandson of Henry.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">Two descendants of another Samuel Wolcott, 1630-1687, who immigrated to New Jersey in 1661, carry similar Y-DNA to Henry's descendants with a SNP difference. No historical relationship has been found. Samuel may have descended from a Wolcott related to Thomas of Tolland, ancestor of Henry and John.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">CELTIC WALCOTTS AND WOOLCOTTS:
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">The Walcot family of Shropshire, as expected from its Welsh origin, show Celtic Y-DNA, not connected to any other Walcott or Wolcott family. They are currently designated Haplogroup A7901.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">Another English family with the Woolcott surname, originated in Devonshire in the 14th century. It has been given the haplogroup designation, Y24879 (c.1500AD). Our DNA participants showing this DNA includes a descendant of Edward Woolcott of Exeter, c.1600-c.1650, two descendants of John Woolcott, c.1625-1669, who immigrated to Kent Co., Maryland in 1649, and four descendants of Philip Wilcutt (c.1690-1771), of Massachusetts, possibly a son of John Woolcott of Maryland.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">NORDIC WALCOTTS:
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">A family of Walcotts originating in Buckinghamshire in the 14th century, including members who emmigrated to Barbados where they had large sugar plantations, has been designated Haplogroup S18218.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">A different Walcott family, descended from William Walcott who immigrated to Salem MA in 1636, has been designated haplogroup Z17954. Their origin is unknown, but may descend from a Walcott family who lived at Lincolnshire in the 17th century.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">AFRICAN WALCOTTS:
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">We have had three African-American participants; two Walcotts and a Wilcott. Each DNA sample shows African descent in the male lines, descending from three different ancestors in Africa.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">OTHER:
Seven Wolcott participants have DNA that fit in none of these haplogroups, probably due to adoptions or out-of-wedlock parentages. These are called "anomalies". We have also been joined by several individuals who found they unsuspectingly carried Wolcott Y-DNA genes, and have helped some of them identify their Wolcott paternal ancestors.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">HOW TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROJECT:
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">Over 120 Wolcott/Woolcott/Walcot/Walcott, etc. men have participated in this project. Participants are encouraged to use the Family Tree DNA Y-DNA 37 marker test, which is sufficient for most purposes. Some participants have extended their tests to 67 markers, and a few participants have extended their tests to the maximum 111 markers. We compare this with the historical and documentary evidence we have or can find. In most cases the DNA data supports or confirms our expected relationships. In the few cases where this does not happen, we re-examine our data.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">In 2014 a new type of DNA testing became available. It is called the Y500 test, and provides a way to further define and confirm the relationships found in our Y-DNA groupings. Y500 tests examine thousands of known branch markers as well as millions of places where there may be new branch markers. It identifies specific "single-nucleotide polymorphisms" (SNPs) that are shared with people with similar DNA, and the markers that are not shared. Once a SNP is identified as belonging to a branch of the family, individuals who have taken any YDNA marker test can be tested for that SNP alone. This is an inexpensive confirmation of a specific subclade. Twenty of our participants have done either the Y500 or SNP tests. Based on the BigY and related individual SNP tests, we have identified unique SNP markers for several different Wolcott and Walcott families.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">We invite any male Wolcott, Woolcott, Walcott, Walcutt, Woollacott, Willcutt, Wilcott, etc. to participate in our DNA project. We especially encourage Woolcotts and Walcotts who have other descent than from Henry and John Wolcott of Somerset to help us expand our knowledge of those families. Charles Wolcott of Houston TX, who has handled the technical part of the project, recently retired, and has selected Charlie Wolcott of London, England, to supervise that part of the project. His email address is charles.wolcott@ mac.com. If you are interested in participating in this test, please let Charlie know.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">DNA evidence is supported by available historical records. DNA can tell that two individuals are genetically related, but not specifically how they are related. Historical records can often show the exact relationship, supported by the DNA evidence. John B. Wolcott of Corvallis OR, currently supervises that aspect of the project. If you give him your Wolcott/Walcott/Wilcott line of descent as far back as you know it, he will be happy to assist you in connecting your genealogical line with known Wolcott/Walcott/etc. family data. For this assistance please contact him at johnwolcott@ mail.com. If you participate in the Wolcott project, Charlie and John will receive the results of your test to compare with other participants' results. Your information will be used only for that purpose. If you wish more anonymity, we suggest you sign up for the DNA test using your Wolcott grandfather's name.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">You can register yourself and order a DNA kit by going to www.familytreedna.com/, then clicking on "Surname Projects", then on "W", and then on "Wolcott". At the bottom of that page is an order form that will allow you to join the Wolcott Surname Project and order a test kit from FTDNA. The current cost of the basic Y-DNA37 test is $79, but if you order through our Wolcott group there may be a discount. Once your order is placed, it will take a week to ten days to receive your DNA test kit from FTDNA. The test itself is simple, involving a swab of the inner cheek with a cotton swab. After your test kit is returned to the FTDNA laboratory, in a provided return envelope, it will take about six weeks to receive your results. We will be available to assist in the interpretation of those results.
