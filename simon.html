His obituary in the Hillsdale Herald says: "Newell Wolcott was born Nov. 15 1812, in the town of Leroy, Genessee Co. N. Y. He came west when twenty years of age and bought forty acrs of land near Rollersville, Sandusky Co., Ohio, in what was then known as the "black swamp". He was married in 1836 to Miss Elizabeth Cruson, one of twelve sisters, his present widow, and soon after removed to Erie Co. Ohio, where he continued to reside until six years ago when he removed to this place. Since then he has made this his home. During his early wedded life he was sorely pushed at times to get the necessities of life, but by industry and frugality he succeeded in amassing a competency sufficient to leave his widow and daughter above want. He was always generous to the poor, helping those who needed help, and never distressing those who had business relations with him, as many can testify. During his longand painful illness not one impatient word passed his lips. "It is all right", was his frequent expression, willing to live for the sake of his blind wife and saddened household of his only child, yet prepared to die, he quietly passed away on the 13th of February 1884 at the age of 71 years and 3 months, leaving a host of friends and relatives to mourn his death."
