<div class="descendantDiv">NOTE: A Wolcott/Walcott DNA study is now underway. There are currently two Shropshire Walcots participating, descendants of two sons of Rev. Charles Walcot, 1794-1875. Their results are distinct from all other participants, indicating a different original ancestor, unrelated by blood to other Walcott, Wolcott, and Wilcott participants in our tests. The Walcot family of Shropshire appears to have few remaining descendants in the male line. For more information about the DNA project, return to the main menu and go to the DNA page.

<div class="descendantDiv">The name, Walcot, is an English place name, probably derived from "Walh", meaning "Welch" or "Wald", meaning "forest", and "cot", meaning "house". The Shropshire family derives their name from a hamlet named Walcot, formerly in the manor of Lydbury, near the town of Bishops Castle. Bishops Castle is named for the castle erected there by the Bishop of Hereford, who was lord of Lydbury Manor.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">A family pedigree was registered with the Herald's office by Humphrey Walcot, Jr., during the Visitation of Shropshire of 1623. The 1623 Visitation is shown below in italics. Other family papers of the Walcot family, now deposited in the Shropshire Records and Research Centre at Shrewsbury, were the source of information published in 1930 by Rev. John R. Burton as The History of the Family of Walcot of Walcot. Information from the Burton book, Antiquities of Shropshire, by Robert Eaton, and from other sources, have been added to the Visitation pedigree. Additional information is from the Walcot Newsletter, published by the late Michael G. Walcott of Beaminster, Dorset, the International Genealogical Institute, other internet public records, and the files of John B. Wolcott.
</div>

<hr class="thick">

<div class="descendantDiv">(1) Trahairn ap Jerworth of Gorthmoc, m. Dyddgo, filia Meridithe ap Rob't of Kedowan. Trahairn is said to be the son of Iorworth, son of Einion, son of Rees, son of Llewelyn Vynchan, son of Llewelyn ap Coel "Aurdochog" who married Effa, sister of Bleddyn ap Cynfyn, Lord of Powis in Wales who lived 1025-1075. Preservation of genealogies was part of the Welsh culture, and this and some following generations are probably from a Welch source. The accuracy of this pedigree is uncertain.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(2) Jerworth, m. Jane, filia Petri Corbet militis. The Corbets came from Normandy with William the Conqueror and settled in Shropshire where they built Castle Caus and were among the leading Shropshire families in the 12th and 13th centuries.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(3) Rhees ap Jerworth, m. Jonetta, filia Einani Penn de Morcheir.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(4) David ap Rees de Becthw., m. Jana, fil. Unica et Haer Joh'is Walcot militis. Jane was only daughter and heiress of John Walcot, knight, probably John of Walcott, not necessarily a surname.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(5) Jevan Walcot de Walcot, m. Ann, filia Joh'is Mynde.  Evan Walcot, if 10 generations removed from Llewelyn Aurdorchog, born c. 1005, would probably have been born after 1300, inconsistant with the following dates.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">William de Walcote held Walcot under the Bishop of Hereford. He was the first Walcot to have left an historical record. In 1221 he gave security for Grent de Middleton of Middleton. He may have been the father or uncle of Roger, below.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(6) Rogerus Walcot de Walcot, m. Editha, fil. Willi. Downes militis. Roger Walcot, c.1210 - c.1280; married Edith Downes. Roger de Walcote was named as a Shropshire juror in 1252, 1255, and 1256.  An inquest of 1255 states that Roger de Walcot held a quarter of a hide in Walcot by a rent of 8s payable to the Bishop of Hereford. Roger de Walecot witnessed a deed at Edgeton c.1265. In 1278 Roger de Walecote quit-claimed to William Bagard a meadow in Walecot called Hidichedemedue.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(7) Philipus Walcot de Walcot, m. Juliana, filia Johis Herle, b. c.1235.; m. Juliana Herle. His father, living in 1278, may have survived him, explaining why no historic record of him is known.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(8) Joh'es Walcot de Walcot, m. Alicia fil. Davidis Lloyd ap Sr. Griffith Vychan, c.1260 - c.1320. In 1283, John, son of Philip de Walcote, granted one messuage in Walcote with 4 virgates (120 acres) of land, 20 acres of woods, 20 acres of meadow, and 12s annual rent to Reginald fitz Walter, who in turn settled it on John, son of Philip de Walcote and his heirs by his wife Isolde at a penny rent. This was apparently a marriage settlement at the time of John's marriage to Isolde fitz Walter. Alice Lloyd may have been a second wife, or, more likely, was confused with Margaret, daughter of David Lloyd, son of Sir Griffith Vychan, who married another Roger Walcot, below. John de Walcote witnessed a deed at Ludlow in 1291, and a John de Walcote was a juror in the Purslow Hundred Assize of 1292. Purslow was about 2 miles from Walcot. In 1284, 1305 and 1315 John witnessed deeds at Edgeton, Shropshire. John is also named in a deed of 1310, and was a witness in 1309 and 1313. In 1316 John de Walcote was lord of the vill of Walcote.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">A Shropshire lay subsidy tax roll dated 1327, names all land holders, including four Walcots at Lydbury North, the parish where Walcot was located, and one at nearby Clunbury. (Antiquities of Shropshire) John is not named on the roll so was probably dead. The men named on this roll may be his brothers or cousins.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">1. Adam de Walcot was the wealthiest of these, paying a tax of 2s 4d at Lydbury North in 1327. He was one of 6 men, 2 from Shrewsbury, owing &pound60 to Sir Richard de Hawley in 1301.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">2. Philip Walcot paid a tax in 1327 of 18d at Oakley and 12d at Clunbury. Oakley was a town 3 miles east of Walcot. Clunbury was a manor 3 miles south of Walcot.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">3. William de Walcote paid 16d tax at Lydbury North in 1327. He was a juror at Montgomery in 1301, and was witness to deeds at Lydbury in 1327, 1328, and 1330, and at Edgeton in 1344.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">4. David de Walcot paid a tax of 15d at Lydbury North in 1327. David de Walcote was a witness to deeds at Lydbury in 1318, 1327 and 1328; in 1357 Reginald, son of David de Walcot of Shropshire was creditor of &pound20 owed by John le Skyer of Little Stretton. Reginald de Walcote, son of David, witnessed a deed at Lydbury in 1349.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">5. Henry de Walcot paid 13d tax at Lydbury North in 1327.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(9) Rogerus de Walcot, b. c.1315. There was no Roger Walcot listed on the Shropshire Lay Subsidy of 1327, possibly because he was underage at that time. One of the Walcots above may have been his guardian during his minority.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(10) Joh'es Walcot de Walcot in com. Salop miles. anno 6 R.2.  Arms: on a cross patonce azure 5 fleur-de-lis or. This name was probably placed here in error, as it apparently refers to an unrelated Sir John de Walcote, of Walcote by Luttersworth, Leicester, who had two daughters who were his co-heiresses and used these arms. The year, 6 Richard II, or 1383, probably refers to the date the arms were recorded by the heralds.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">A contemporary was Edward de Walcote who witnessed a deed at Lydbury in 1368.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(11) Thomas Walcott, A.D. 1405. If Thomas was the grandfather of John, below, he was probably born about 1345, and son of Roger, above. The date given here, 1405, apparently represents evidence shown to the herald at the time of the Visitation. It may have been a deed or inquisition taken at the time of Thomas' death, showing his heir as John Walcot, below.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(12) John Walcot, probably b. c.1370 .
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(13) John Walcot of Walcot, anno 3 Henry V, arms, argent a chevron between three chess rooks ermines, m. Matilda, daughter of Sir Richard Cornwall of Bereford. John was probably born about 1390. The date, 3 Henry V, or 1416, was apparently the date the heralds registered the chess rook arms. John's father-in-law, Sir Richard de Cornwall, Baron Burford, 1360-1443, was second cousin of Sir John Cornwall, Baron Stanhope, 1364-1443, who married Henry V's aunt, Princess Elizabeth. In 1439 Sir John Cornwall placed the manor of Ampthill, Bedfordshire, in trust with the Archbishop of Canterbury, John Walcote, and others. In 1452 John Walcote quitclaimed his rights to the manor of Ampthill to John Cornwall's step-son, Henry, Duke of Exeter.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">King Henry V is said to have granted the chess rooks arms to John for defeating the king at chess, but it is more likely that they were derived from the town of Bishops Castle, a village located 3 miles from the Walcot lands. Burke's Landed Gentry shows this John as son of John Walcot and Alice Lloyd, above, but those dates don't seem to fit.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">Contemporary with John was William Walcot of Walcot, who was Collector for Shropshire in 1401, 1419, 1440, 1442, and 1445. William was apparently born about 1375.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(14) Rogerus Walcot de Walcot, Ar., m. Margareta fillia Davidis Lloyd ap Ll'nn ap Griffith de Mathuvar, Armigeri. Roger was probably born about 1420. Armiger means that Roger was the acknowleged bearer of a coat of arms, in this case the chess rook arms granted to his father, John Walcot, above. Roger's son, Edward was surity for David Lloyd's nephew.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">David Lloyd, 1395-1497, second son of Sir Griffith Vychan, c.1375-1447. "At a seat called Mathavarn... resided the famous seer and bard of the 15th century, David Llwydd" (National Gazetteer, 1868). David Lloyd was the bard who told Henry Tudor that he would be victorious at Bosworth Field in 1485. A poem about Sir Griffith Vychan ap Griffith who was executed in 1447 for supporting the House of York, was written by David Lloyd of Mathavern. Another Lloyd-Walcot connection is given on a list of officials of Montgomeryshire: "Thomas Walcot, serviens ad Ed'r'us Lloyd de Mathrafal, ar."
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">A contemporary was Walter Walcote who quit-claimed to Joan, late wife of Roger Jones of Lydbury, all his right to 3 acres of meadow in the fee of Walcot and 2 shillings yearly paid him for 2 messuages and 3 acres of meadow in the village and fields of Walcot reserving yearly one rose if demanded.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(15) Edwardus Walcot de Walcot, Ar., m. Auicia fil. et haer Thomas English militis. Edward, c.1450-1500, said to have married Alice, daughter of Sir Thomas English. Edward Walcot and others were surities for Reynold, son of Sir Griffith Vaughn regarding a marriage settlement for Reynold's son in 1475-85. Reynold was eldest son of Sir Griffith, and brother of David Lloyd, above. In 1497 Edward Wallcot witnessed a deed at Edgeton, Shropshire.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">Edward is sometimes said to have had a younger brother, John, who married Alice, dau. and heiress of James Goldsmith and had children Humphrey and Alice. Humphrey died young. Alice is sometimes said, in error, to be the Alice Walcott who was mother of Jane Heckington 1500-1587, wife of William Cecil, Lord Burleigh. This Alice was the daughter of Thomas de Walcot of Lincolnshire, for which see "The Walcotts of Eastern England".
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(16) Joh'es Walcot de Walcot, Ar., m. Margareta, fil. Ed'r'i Plowden de Plowden Hall in com. Salop. This John was probably born about 1470. Burke gives Margaret Plowden, wife of John Walcot of Walcot as daughter of Edmund Plowden, 1517-1584, which does not fit this time frame.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">In 1508, Humphrey Sandford of Plowden was granted the wardship of Humphrey, son and heir of John Walcot, who held of knight service, recently deceased, and all his property and the marrying of Humphrey during his minority, and if he died before coming of lawful age, Sandford was to have the custody and marriage of Humphrey's brother, John, and sisters, Margaret and Elizabeth, if still under age. Humphrey Walcot apparently died young as John, below, is listed in the Visitation as John Walcot's heir.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(17) Humphrey Walcot, c.1503-c.1515.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(17) Joh'es Walcot de Walcot m. Maria, filia Petri Newton militis, arms: argent a cross fleury gules. John, b. c.1507, m. Mary Newton, said to have been the daughter of Sir Peter Newton of Highley, Shropshire, a member of the Council of Henry VII, who m. Agnes, daughter of Geoffrey Kyffin and grandaughter of George Stanley, Earl of Derby. Mary m. (2) Thomas Acton of Acton Scott.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(18) Carolus Walcot de Walcot in com. Salop, Ar.; m.(1) Margareta filia Johannis Isham, son to Roger; m. (2) Beatrixt fil Antho Gerling per filiam Tho. Seckford de com. Suff. Charles Walcot, c. 1545-1596, bur. Lydbury North; his father died while he was a minor, and Charles was a ward of Sir Henry Sidney, KG. He was a student at the Middle Temple. In 1571 and 1579 Charles Walcot, of Llanfair-in-Bulith was sheriff of Breconshire. About 1570 the town of Bishop's Castle and surrounding lands became crown property. Crown lands in Bishops Castle were purchased by the Walcots in 1573. At that time a new town charter was granted with powers of self-government and the right to send two members to Parliament. Charles Walcot was one of the burgesses named in that charter. Charles was MP for Bishop's Castle in the Parliament of 1586 and 1588. He m. (1) Margaret Isham, dau. of John Isham by whom he had no children; m. (2) 1566 at Ludlow to Beatrice Gerling, dau. of Sir Anthony Gerling, KG, and Elizabeth Seckford. Elizabeth Seckford was a first cousin of Charles' guardian, Sir Philip Sidney, and closely related to Sir Henry Sidney KG and Lord Deputy of Ireland, Sir Robert Sidney, Viscont Lisle and Earl of Leicester, William, Earl of Pembroke, and Philip, Earl of Montgomery.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(19) Carolus Walcot de Walcot in com. Salop., Ar., filius et haeres m. (2) Elizabetha filia Joh'is Games de Newton in co. Breknok, arms:Sable a chevron between three spears heads argent. Charles Walcot Jr., 1567-1630, graduated from Oxford 1585, was a student at Middle Temple 1587. Charles Walcot Jr. of Llanhamlach was Sheriff of Brecon, Wales, living at Bulith, Breckon. He sold the Walcot family estates at Lydbury to his uncle, Humphrey in 1611; overseer of the will of Joan Games, wife of John Parry, in 1617. His son, Thomas, stated that his father was killed in 1641 by Irish Papists. He may have meant his brother, John, born 1619. He m. (1) Mary Forster, m. (2) c. 1610 Elizabeth Games, dau. of Sir John Games of Newton, Breckon.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(20) Isham Walcot; m. Morgan Jeffries.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(20) Beatrix, uxor Joh'is Dive de Bromham in com. Bedf. militis, renupta Joh'i Digby Comiti Bristoliae anno 1623. Apparently in error, as records indicate she was born c.1574 and so must have been a daughter of Charles Walcot, Sr.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(20) Maria. Mary Walcot, b. c.1613, m. 1628 John Minchin, an "adventurer" in Ireland. Their children included Charles, Humphrey, Ambrose, and Sarah Minchin. Charles' son, Edward Minchin, was father of John Minchin, 1700-1753, who took the name John Minchin Walcott, having married the daughter of his father's cousin, Catherine Walcot, below, and succeeding to the estates of her brother, John Walcot, in 1736. John Minchin Walcott left his estates to his brother, William Walcott Minchin, and to Paul Minchin, son of his cousin, Edward Minchin, provided they also assumed the surname of Walcott.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(20) Charles Walcot, b. c.1615, d. y.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(20) Johannes Walcot. John Walcot, Jr., born 1619, was a child of Charles' second wife; perhaps the Walcot who was killed in 1641 "by Irish Papists".
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(20) Capt. Edward Walcot of Sherbourne, Dorset, b. c.1621, d. 1671; in 1651 sold his residence called Nash Court with 380 acres of land at Marnhull, Dorset, to George Hussey, husband of his cousin Elizabeth, dau. of Ellis Walcot, below, his children apparently having died young; m.

He was executed in 1683 for his part in the Rye House Plot, a conspiracy to assassinate Charles II and his brother, James, Duke of York, as they traveled from the Newmarket races to London past Rye House in Hertfordshire. The plot was aborted but was betrayed to the government. His attainder was reversed in 1696 in favor of his eldest son, John. Thomas m. Jane Blayney, dau. Thomas Blayney and niece of Baron Blaney.

Walcot himself, however, appears to have fought for the King and was captured at the siege of Shrewsbury in February 1645, and imprisoned in Powis Castle until ransomed. Inheriting an estate of &pound900 p.a. encumbered by &pound6,000 debt, during the Interregnum, he lived in retirement until 1660, paying off the debt with so much success that he was able to give financial assistance to ejected ministers, both Presbyterian and Anglican.

Chosen for the county without opposition in 1685, he was moderately active in James II's Parliament, with appointments to the committees on the bills to rebuild Lord Powis's house in Lincoln's Inn Fields, to repair Bangor Cathedral, and to relieve insolvent debtors. When the King was to make a progress through Shropshire in 1687, Walcot was asked to make arrangements ‘that the whole militia be drawn forth at his entry, with as many of the gentlemen as could be got together'. He did so, but excused himself from attending on the plea that ‘the journey would be very troublesome to him'. To Lord Chancellor Jeffreys, the lord lieutenant, he wrote on 31 Mar. 1688: ‘I cannot in conscience comply with your lordship's proposals in taking off the Penal Laws or Tests. I shall always continue my allegiance to the King, and live peaceably with my neighbours'. Removed from the county commissions, he was restored by Jeffreys six months later.

In 1727 he purchased the manor of Bishops Castle from his uncle, the Duke of Chandos, for 7,000L; in 1728 he was also lord of the Hundred and Manor of Purslow. He was a burgess of Ludlow 1719. In 1727, with an income of &pound3,000 a year, burdened with a debt of &pound22,000, he stood for Parliament against Chandos's advice to wait till he had paid off the debt. Elected as a Tory, he voted against the Government. He was lord of the manor of Clun with its ruined castle in 1731. In 1732 he held the lordship of Clun, hundreds of Clun and Parslow, manor of Bishops Castle and Astwood, Manor of Down and Acton, Walcot Hall in Lydbury North, etc., which were at that time placed in trust with George Walcot of Ludlow and Humphrey Walcot of Bitterley to provide an 800 pound annuity for his wife, Mary Dashwood, dau. of Sir Francis Dashwood, Bart.. Though Walcot did not stand again he continued to support his political interests at Bishop's Castle, plunging deeper into debt. In 1741, his settled estate and part of his late wife's marriage portion were placed in the hands of trustees to raise money to pay the debts and secure an equivalent for the benefit of his male heir. Under the influence of his brother-in-law, Sir Francis Dashwood, he ran up large debts improving his home and gardens.. Sir Francis Dashwood was a notorious rake and intimate friend of the Prince Regent. By 1742 John owed over &pound33,000 and was forced to procure a private Act of Parliament to raise money on his wife's portion. Before the election of 1747 he borrowed &pound8,500 on mortgage from his banker. In 1760 he was lord of the honour of Clun and lord of the Manor of Bishop's Castle, Sadley, and Astwood. He also owned the Castle Hotel in Bishops Castle, but the end came in 1761 when his debts had risen to over &pound48,000. He was forced to conceal himself from his creditors, leaving his son and lawyer to sell his property, including Walcot, land in the town of Bishops Castle, and the manor of Clun, to Lord Clive for the inflated price of &pound92,000.

The crescent indicates Humphrey was a second son.
