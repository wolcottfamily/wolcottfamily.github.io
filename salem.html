<div class="descendantDiv">William Walcott of Salem MA was the head of the third Wolcott/Walcott family in America. DNA studies show that William's descendants have DNA quite distinct from any other Walcott, Walcot, Wolcott, etc. families. His descendant's DNA is classified as "Nordic", probably derived from Danes or Normans who settled on the East coast of England. William may descend from a Walcott family who lived at Lincolnshire in the 15th through 17th century, for whom we have no DNA study participants.

<div class="descendantDiv">(1) William Walcott, b. c.1610, was granted 30 acres of land at Jeffrey's Creek near Salem MA in 1636. He must have returned to England, however, as he is listed as leaving England for America in 1638: "William Walcot for Capt. Butler, passenger for Providence Island by the Swallow". William held land at Salem for a family of 4 people in 1640. He married Alice Ingersoll, daughter of Richard Ingersoll of Salem. Richard Ingersoll's daughter, Alice Walcott, was mentioned in his will to receive "my house at town with 10 acres upland & meadow after my wifes decease." William Walcott was one of several residents of Salem, including the founder of Rhode Island, Roger Williams, who were censured in a letter from the Salem church to the Dorchester Church, dated 1639: "William Walcott for refusing to bring his child to the ordinance, neglecting willingly family duties, etc." This probably means that he did not have his child baptized, and may indicate he was a follower of Roger Williams who advocated adult baptism. The Quarterly Court at Salem ordered in 1642 that William Walcott be whipped for idleness. Essex Co. Quarterly Court records state: "Willia. Walcotts wife children & estate committed to Richard Inkersell hs father in law 27:10:1643 to be disposed of according to God and the said Wm. Walcott to bee & Remaine as his servant." William is thought to have left Salem about 1644, leaving his family behind. In that year a law was passed saying that all who opposed infant baptism were subject to banishment from the colony. In 1651 he or another William Walcott was a shoals witness in Maine. In 1652 the Salem records show that "means were taken by the court to preserve his estate." This probably included selling his land, because in 1652, Robert Goodell of Salem owned land at Salem which included 30 acres that had formerly been granted to William Walcott.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(2?) Alice Walcott, b. c.1637, d. 1714 Northampton MA; m. (1) Francis Bennett c.1650, who died 1655 Boston MA, m. (2) Ralph Hutchinson 1656 Boston MA. Alice is said to be a daughter of William Walcott, but no evidence to support this has been found. Her name, Alice, however is the same as William's wife.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(2) Abraham Walcott, b. c.1640 Salem Village MA, d. 1699 Salem Village MA. Abraham Walcott witnessed a deed by Jane and Thomas Parker at Boston 1658, but another account says he was age 37 when he married in 1682 making him b. 1645, probably too young to have been a witness in 1658. Abraham Walcott was witness to a deed of land in Maine granted to Walter Phillips by Indians, recorded at Sheepscott ME 1663. In 1670 Abraham Walcott, husbandman, purchased from Joseph Foster of Salem for 25L 8 acres of land with an incomplete frame house, and is recorded at Salem Village 1678. In 1681 Abraham Walcott was taxed at Salem for the church rate, and enrolled as a freeman of Salem Village 1690. In 1696 Abraham Walcott, yeoman, and wife signed a mortgage on a house and 32 acres next to John Wolcott, with John Wolcott as a witness; Abrahan was living at Salem Village during the 1692-3 witchcraft trials but did not participate in them; m. (1) Ruth Hooper 1682 Salem Village, m. (2) Abigail Briggs 1689 Salem MA. It is possible that he had an unknown first wife who was the mother of a Mary Walcott who was born c.1678 and married David Harwood 1701 Salem MA.

Deponent in Wharton vs. Elson, 1675, Thomas Wilkott, mariner, aged about 35 years testifies that he knows the substance of what is above written and deposed to be true, he being boatswain of the said ship. The ship in question was the Blessing, James Elson, master, trading between Boston, the French West Indies, and France. This and the above from Sussex Co. Court records. It is possible that the "Mrs. Hannah Woolcott, single person," who died 1683 at Boston was his wife.

<div class="descendantDiv">(2?) William Wilcott, b. c.1645 Salem MA, d. c.1700, took the oath of allegiance at Boston in 1678 and appears on the 1681 tax roll at Boston. In 1682 William Willcutt attended a meeting in Boston for the formation of an association to settle Sheepscott, ME. In 1688 John Tucker of Newbury petitioned to settle 150 acres of land on west side of Draper's River at Dartmouth, Cornwall Co., with a two acre home lot adjoining the lands of Wilcotts. William Willcott signed his mark as the only witness to a deposition made by Thomas Gent at Boston in 1689 in which Thomas deposed that on a march along the Kennebeck River they met Gov. Andros and Gent told him that his men were in no condition to go after the Indians due to some men were sick, some lame, some tired. Andros said he would get the Indians if Gent identified them, or send other Indians to get them, possihbly Mohawks. William Willcutt was living at Sheepscott ME in 1689. William Wilcott testified against Lt. Jordan, charged with treason and cruelty by the residents of Eastern, at Boston 1690, giving his age as 45, and late an inhabitant of New Dartmouth (Sheepscott). An undated document reads: "Widow Wilcott claims a Tract of Land on ye West Side Sheepcott River below ye falls beginning at ye great Springs agst ye falls & along the River Side to a small Spring on ye Nor. sd of Saml Corrbison house qts, about one hundred acres which Land was in ye possession of Thomas Mercer & given to Wm. Wilcott Deced and by him in his lifetime Improved and Enjoyed Several years till ye warrs, witness Thos Jent,  Robt Scott." William's wife was probably a daughter of Thomas and Edith Mercer of Sheepscott. The residents of Sheepscott, including William Wilcott and the Mercers, were forced to leave Maine due to hostile Indians in October of 1676. They were in Boston MA in 1682, with others that were planning to resettle Sheepscott.

William Willcut" This deed was acknowleged at Boston by Mr. William Wilcott on the same date and recorded 1743. Thomas Westbrooke of Portsmouth, NH, was commissioned to organize a military force to range from Kennebeck to Penobscott, ME, to control the Indians there. They fought battles at Piscatagua, Penobscott, Pemmequid and other locations. Two muster rolls for these troops exist. One, dated July-December 1722 contains the names of William Wilcote, Sgt., and William Wilcote, sentinel. Another roll for 22 Nov. 1724-22 May 1725 lists the name of Thomas Willcott.
