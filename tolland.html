<div class="descendantDiv">Information about Tolland was begun being collected for the Wolcott family in 1849 by H. G Somerby, who found information from parish church records, wills, and the 1525 Lay Subsidy Rolls. The information was added to by English historians, Eric Poole and Robin Bush, in the 1980s.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">In preparation for the Wolcott Family Society visit to Tolland in 2018, additional material about Tolland was collected and presented to the group in a talk given by John B. Wolcott at the Castle Hotel in Taunton. Forty American Wolcotts attended the Reunion. The group received a warm welcome from the Tolland people, with a packed church on Sunday for a service led by the Rt. Rev. Ruth Wolsey, Bishop of Taunton, a pig roast luncheon at Brompton Ralph for the Wolcotts and the residents of Tolland and Brompton Ralph, and visits to properties formerly owned by Wolcotts.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">Additional information was collected in 2019. A project to preserve the information for others to use and to raise funds for the Tolland church was presented to the Wolcott Family Society in 2020. These 118 pages are the results. Information in them was gathered from the publications of the Wolcott Family Society, documents preserved in the British National Archives and the South West Heritage Trust, and various other publications and internet sites by John B. Wolcott. The material was given to the Wolcott Family Society with the understanding that it would be used for promoting donations to the parish church of Tolland for the preservation and maintenance of the church.
