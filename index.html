		Information about American Wolcotts has been collected by the Wolcott Society for over 120 years. Our database is a definative source for information about Wolcotts, Walcotts, Wilcotts, and Woolacotts. There are many other variations on this surname spelling throughout historical records. They should all be included within these records.

Eric Notes: While learning this website's structure after I've used it for its content for so many years, it is very clear to me that this has been a work of phenomenal and continuous efforts by John Wolcott, Charles Waid, and all of the Society Registrars and probably others along the way. The many years of editing and additions make this a fantastic resource for all of our members. Thank you for all of your work, John Wolcott.<br><br>Those that have worked with HTML creation programs know what happens to the coding each time a new revision is added and recompiled. The code becomes more segmented and difficult to work with in the future. Dave's marketing spiel for this job was, "There's nothing much to do!" Since I had nothing to do, I've decided to work through and clean up the HTML code where I can. My intention is to leave the contained information untouched. Let me know if I've made mistakes or caused other issues. Eric<br><br>20260128 - Trying out a revised layout of the first page menu attempting to better show the information we have discovered resulting from DNA testing. Eric
