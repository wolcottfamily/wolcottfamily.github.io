Several Wolcotts have participated in our Wolcott/Woolcott/Walcott DNA study with similar results. These participants have 3 known early ancestors: Robert Woolcott born at Exeter in 1633, John Woolcott who emigrated to America in 1649,and Philip Wilcutt who appears in America c.1710. These are all believed to be descendants of the Woolcott family of Devonshire. We also have 2 Devonshire Woollacott participants who have different DNA from each other and from the former three. We need additional participants from Devonshire Woolcott lines to be able to put together a tree for this family. If you are a male Woolcott or Woollacott with Devonshire ancestry, please consider participating in the Wolcott/Walcott DNA study. For more information return to the main menu and go to the DNA page.

<hr class="thick">

<div class="descendantDiv">The Devonshire surnames, Wolcott,Woolcott, and Woolacott come from the name of a farm and tenement in the parish of Thrushelton, Devonshire. Thrushelton is located on the edge of Dartmoor, between the towns of Okehampton and Lifton. The name is derived from "Wulfnoth's cote", meaning house of Wulfnoth, Wulfnoth being a Saxon given name. The name is first found on an assize roll for Lifton Hundred dated 1238, where William Corbet and Robert de Wlnethecote are listed as pledges for William Atwater. The name also appears on a Devonshire subsidy roll dated 1330 as Wolnethecote, and on an assize roll dated 1364 as Wolthecote. On the subsidy roll of 1332, the name was simply Wollecote. Today, this farm is called Wollacott Farm.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">Two major sources for the genealogy presented here are a genealogy of descendants of Ralph Wolcott of Thrushelton found in a collection of documents called the Wollocomb Mss. from Stowford, now at the Devon Record Office, and a genealogy recorded by the English heralds during the Visitation of Devonshire in 1620. Names listed in the Visitation document are given below in italics.
</div>

<hr class="thick">

<div class="descendantDiv">(1) John de Wollecote, c.1300-c.1350, is listed on the Lay Subsidy Roll of 1332 as one of the ten residents of the manor of Thrushelton who were freemen with property to be taxed. He paid a tax of 12d, the amount paid by most of the freemen of this manor. By this time, family names were becoming fairly well fixed, so although the "de" only indicates that John held the farm known then as Wollecote, it is also likely that he was the earliest known ancestor of those who later bore the family name of Wolcott or Woolcott. No other Wolcotts are found on this 1332 tax roll that lists all of the tax paying residents of the county of Devon. The next Wolcotts that we have record of were a Ralph and a Richard Wolcott. They were contemporaries and were probably born about 1330. They may have been sons of John. Ralph held the property called Wollecote, and was the ancestor of most, if not all, Devonshire Wolcotts.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(2?) Richard Wollecote, c.1330-c.1390. According to documents of the Cary family, Richard Wollocote and his wife, Sarah, granted their estate in Westmonaton, in the manor of Mormalherbe, to Thomas Carey, rector of Ashwater, in 1380. It appears that Richard and Sarah had no children to inherit their land. Possibly Sarah was a Cary and the land was a marriage portion which was returned to the Cary family because of a childless marriage. Moor Malherbe, also known as Moor Vipont, was a manor in Broadwoodwidger parish, near Thrushelton.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(2) Ralph Wollecote, c.1330-c.1400, and his, wife Meliora, are mentioned in several documents in the Wollocombe Manuscripts. There may have been other Wolcotts who died out in the plague years of the 14th century. This disease reached Devon in the winter of 1348-9, and nearly half the population of England were killed by it. Ralph seems to have been the ancestors of all later Devonshire Wolcotts. Four of Ralph's children, Thomas, Henry, Joan and Alice, are named in the Wollocombe documents.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(3) Thomas Wollecote, c.1355-c.1420, is mentioned in several of the Wollocombe documents as the son and heir of Ralph and Meliora. He resided at Wyke in Sourton. Meliora may have been a member of the Wyke family that lived at Sourton. According to the Wollocombe documents, Thomas was the father of John Wolcott, and grandfather of Joan Wolcott who married John Bidlake. In 1506, Nicholas Stapilhill, brought suit against John Bidlake's son or grandson, Thomas Bidlake, claiming the Wolcott properties at Thrushelton. A genealogy was attached to this claim showing: "Ralph Wolocott, held lands - Meliora, mother of Thomas Wolocot who had issue John Wolocott the said donor that died without issue & children & heirs; Henry Wolocott brother of Thomas, who had issue John Wolocott, who had issue John Wolocott, who had issue Ri. Wolocott who had issue Marjorie who had issue Nicholas Staplehill that dd." Nicholas Staplehill's claim appears to have prevailed because there is a deed conveying the lands in question to him.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(4) John Wollecote s. & h., c.1385-c.1440. John is mentioned both in the Wollocombe Mss. and in the 1620 Visitation of Devon. The Visitation gives his father as Walter Wolcott, in error. In 1431 John Bidlake signed a conveyance to John Wollecote, son of Thomas Wollecote of Wyke, of lands called Wollecote and Blakeland in the manor of Thrushelton, conveyed to him by Meliora Wolcott, and lands called Wyke and Southedon in the manor of Sourton that had been conveyed to him by the aforesaid John Wolcott. These lands were probably settled on John Bidlake and and Joan Wolcott at the time of their marriage. There are other charters among the Wollocombe papers, dated 1433, and signed by John Wollecote at Wyke where he was apparently living. In these deeds John Wolcott released his claim to lands at Thrushelton and Sourton to John Bidlake. Descendants of his uncle, Henry, later challenged this gift in court. The 1433 deed gives John's wife's name as Margery. John was probably the person named in the Calendar of Patent Rolls for 1416-22: "John Wolcotes, Robert Carey, Henry Foleford, John Jaysen, and Roger Wyke to inquire about tresspass in Dartmoor."
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(5) Johanna d. & h. - John Bidelake 2 sons 2 daus., c.1405-c.1431. A notation on the Visitation document adds: "Joan, d. & h. of John Wolcott was married to John Bidlake & by him had issue 2 sonnes & 2 daughters, and conveied the lands of Walcote to the use of the said John and Joan, and the heires of their bodies lawfully begotten, and for default of such issue, to the heires of the same John Bidlake for ever; and afterwards the same Joan and all her children died of the plague without issue, where by Bidlake and his heires had the lands of Walcott. John Walcott of Chudley & John his son did commonly beare but only the armes of Skerret with his father's crest. Entered, not signed." After the death of Joan and her children, John Bidlake married Joan Combe and had other children. A document of 1454 in the Wollocombe manuscript collection pardons them for marrying in ignorance of a bar of sanguinuity. John Bidlake must have been born about 1405 and probably married Joan Wolcott about 1425. John Bidelake of Bidelake was Collector for Devon in 1442.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(3) Joan Wolcott, c.1365-. Joan, is identified in the Wollocombe documents as a sister of Henry Wolcott, and wife of Jordan Langston.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(3) Alice Wolcott, c.1365-. Alice is identified in the Wollocombe documents as another sister of Henry Wolcott, and wife of John Cranford.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(3) Henry Wolcott, c.1360-c.1440, is shown in the Wollocombe documents to be son of Ralph Wolcott and younger brother of Thomas Wolcott, above. Following the great plague years, many of the great English landowners found it difficult to find people to work their lands, so they often found it easier to sell them. Often the land was sold to their tenants, as seems to have been the case with Thrushelton. A survey of 1428 shows that in that year Thomas Wrey, John atte Mill, Henry Wolcote, and Thomas Lucas were tenants in chief at Thrushelton of one half a knight's fee, formerly held by Henry de la Pomeroy, with the land divided among them. These men had bought the manor of Thrushelton, and had become freeholders, holding their land directly from the King. Henry's nephew, John Woolcott, and John's son-in-law, John Bidlake, probably held their land at Thrushelton as their tenants. Henry is named as residual heir to the Wolcott properties at Thrushelton and Sourton in the deed of 1431. In 1506, Henry Wolcott's descendant, Nicholas Staplehill, brought suit against John Bidlake's son or grandson, Thomas Bidlake, claiming the Wolcott properties as Henry's heir.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(4) John Wolcott, c.1385-c.1460. According to the 1506 document, Henry's eldest son was named John. Twelve miles east of Thrushelton lies the city of Okehampton, which had grown up next to the castle of the Earls of Devon. The town became a center of trade for the western half of the county of Devon. In 1436, William Denbold, John Rysdon, Jr., John Wolcote, and three others, acting as trustees for the church lands at Okehampton, granted a parcel of land known as "le hammede" to William Furse in exchange for an acre of land which lay within land belonging to St. James Chapel. This John may have been Henry's son.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(5) John Wolcott, c.1410-. John is shown in the Wollocomb Mss. as son and heir of John, above. It is possible that John did business at Exeter, for J. Wolcok is listed on the Mayor's Court Roll of Exeter in 1436, and J. Wylcot in 1437. There was also a J. Wylcot who was a member of the Exeter Common Council in 1445, and in 1450-53.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(6) Richard Wolcott, c.1435-. According to the above documents, John's son and heir was named Richard. The name is written in an abbreviated form and looks like "Rd.".
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(7) Margery Wolcott, c.1455-c.1500; m. John Staplehill. Richard must have had no sons, for the Bidlake-Wolcott deeds say that his daughter, Margery, was his heiress and that in 1506 her son, Nicholas Staplehill, was heir to the Wolcott property at Thrushelton and Sourton. The Staplehills were a prominent Devonshire family. William Staplehill of Devon, and John Staplehill of Wiltshire and Devon, both died in 1436, and their considerable lands, held directly from the King, were taken by the Crown until John's son, John, came of age in 1444. In 1461 and 1463 John Staplehill was given additional lands at Donsford, Fulford, Melhewysh and in other parishes in Devonshire which had been taken from Baldwin Fulford who was attainted for treason. It was apparently this John's son, John, who married Margery Wolcott.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(8) Nicholas Staplehill, c.1480-1517. When the Bidlakes were sued in 1506 over the property deeded to them by John Wolcott, Margery's son, Nicholas Staplehill was the heir to the Wolcott and Wyke properties. Nicholas lived at Exeter in the parish of St. Petrox. The parish records of St. Petrox show that Nicholas Stalplehill, gent., was a churchwarden there for 1515 and 1516, and a bayliff when he died there in 1517. There are no further records of Staplehills in that parish, and Nicholas' heirs are unknown, but the John Wolcott, who appears in this parish about then, may have been his heir.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(6?) Thomas Wolcott of Southcott, c. 1435-. In 1465 Joan, late wife of Thomas Walcote of Southcote, took John Amy, feoffee of William att Well to court regarding a messuage and land in Stanbridge bought by Thomas Walcote from William att Well. Atwell may have been related to John at Wylle who with William Wolcott entered upon the land in Moreton Sampford, Devon, in 1520, claiming title to it, a claim which John Dawe, the younger, disputed. It apears that William Wolcott and John Atwell claimed the land as heirs of John Webber, so they may have been his son-in-laws.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(7) Thomasine, c.1465-c.1550; m. John Cole. Thomasine Wolcott is mentioned in a pedigree registered by the Cole family in the 1620 Visitation of Devon. Here it is recorded that John Cole of Slade married "Thomasine, daughter of Wallcott of Devon." Someone has added to the original document the name of her father as Thomas Wallcott and the arms for her family as: "Azure, a cross patonce charged with 5 fleur de lis or". The arms given are those of Sir John Walcott of Leicester, no relation to the Devonshire Woolcotts. Thomasine's husband, John Cole of Slade, in the parish of Cornwood, Devon, was a large landholder. He was appointed a Justice of the Peace in 1514, and was one of the two High Collectors for Devon of the Great Lay Subsidy collected in 1524. John died in 1543, but his widow, Thomasine was still alive in 1547, named in the will of her son, Thomas Cole.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(6?) John Wolcott, c. 1440-c.1520. There were later Wolcotts living at Okehampton so Richard, who had no sons, may have had one or more brothers. In 1486 John Wolcote was a borough feoffee at Okehampton, and in 1486 and 1487 he was a witness to deeds there. In 1500, John Wolcote was a witness at Okehampton. In 1501 and 1512, he was one of several men named as making a grant of land at Okehampton on behalf of the Chapel of St. James.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(7?) Nicholas Wolcott, c.1475-1530. In 1524/5, Nicholas Wolcott of Lympstone was taxed on 10 pounds in goods, making him one of the wealthier Wolcotts. He died before 1543. There is no proof of his parentage, but he seems likely to have been a son of John Wolcote of Okehampton, and may have been the namesake of Nicholas Staplehill.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(8) John Wolcott, c.1495-c.1550. John Wolcott lived at Littleham, three miles from Lympstone where Nicholas lived. He was taxed on &pound4 in goods in 1524/5, and was a subcollector of the subsidy for East Budleigh Hundred, a position given to relatively prominent men. John Cole, husband of Thomasine Wolcott, above, was one of the two Collectors of this subsidy, and would have assigned the sub-collectors. On the Subsidy Roll of 1543-4, John Wolcott of Littleham paid a tax of &pound20, one of the largest amounts paid by any Wolcott, apparently as heir to Nicholas who is no longer on the rolls.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(7?) John Wolcott, c.1480-c.1570. This John was the wealthiest Wolcott on the subsidy roll of 1524-5. It is likely that he belonged to the Okehampton branch of the family, and we have placed him here as a probable brother of Nicholas. John became a citizen of Exeter in 1517, the very same year that Nicholas Staplehill died, and he resided in St. Petrox parish, where Nicholas had lived. It seems likely that he was a cousin of Nicholas Staplehill, and possibly Nicholas' heir.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">In 1517, John was admitted as a freeman of Exeter by payment of a fine "above all such ware as he has charged in the Germyn". The Germyn was a trading ship out of Exeter, so John must have been involved in trade. Okehampton was an important center of the cloth trade, and John's trade seems to have been in wool cloth. A military survey taken at Exeter in 1522 shows that John Wollecote was enrolled then as a billman, ready for fighting. It also shows that he then had property worth more than &pound10 per year, was required to provide a harness for military purposes, and lived in St. Petrox parish. By 1524, according to Izacke's Antiquities, John Woolcott became the Receiver of the City of Exeter. The Receiver was one of the most important men of the city and a member of the Common Council, a self-perpetuating body of 18 men, who ran the city. The Receiver had the responsibility of seeing that taxes were collected. The subsidy roll for 1524 shows that John Wolcott of St. Petrox parish paid a tax of 40s on goods valued at &pound40 per year, considerable wealth for the time. In 1529, John Wolcote was serving as Constable of the Exeter Staple, responsible for enforcing the trade ordinances of the city. John Wolcote was one of the church wardens of St. Petrox church from 1531 to 1536. In 1542, John Wolcot was the City Treasurer of Exeter, responsible for all of the city's funds. John again served as Reciever in 1543, and in 1545 was Sheriff of the city. In 1544, John Wolcott, merchant, was assessed 20s tax on goods valued at &pound30, somewhat less than he was taxed on in 1524, but still a substantial amount.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">John got himself in trouble during the seige of Exeter in 1549, when Catholic forces surrounded the city. Hooker's History of Exeter records: "And among sundrie some one of theme beinge one of good credyte and countenaunce and of the nomber of the common counsell whose name was John Wolcot a merchaunte was so faire inchaunted herein that upon a certeyne daye he beinge as the course came apointed a capeteyne for the daye and to warde the gates presumynge that partlie by reason of his chardge that daie and partlie for that he was of the common counsell he might doe more thenn in deede aperteygne to him dyd upon his firste communge to the westgate in the mornynge meete with certeyne of his confederates and after conference had with theime wente sodenlie oute of the wicket of the gate and carienge the keyes with him wente unto the rebells and had a longe conference with theyme but it took small effecte for he promysed as it appeared more than he coulde performe whc turned to his great discredyt bothe for that he himselfe verye hardelye escaped theire handes who were bente to have kepte and reteyned hym as also when he came in was both checked and blamed for his doings".
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">When the subsidy roll of 1557-8 was drawn up, John Wolcote had again less wealth. He was assessed 35s 7d on goods valued at &pound13 6s 9d. He was apparently still considered a leading merchant of the city, however, for he was one of the 16 original members of the Merchant Adventurers of Exeter, a group chartered by the Crown to engage in foreign trade at this time. The subsidy roll also shows that John had moved to St. Kerrian parish, possibly due to his declining finances. John apparently turned innkeeper. During the period between 1549 and 1555 church lands were appropriated by the Crown and sold. John purchased such a property located in Exeter from Sir John Williams and Mr. Morris. The property appears to have been an inn in St. John Bows parish, formerly owned by the Priory of Totnes. A decree of the city of Exeter dated 1561 required that every "innholder, taverner, and keeper of a victualinge house" maintain lighted lanterns outside from dark until 11PM. It named the individuals, days, and locations required for this. "John Ulcot, alderman, West Quarter, every night", is one of those named. John's grandson, John apparently owned such an inn in 1584.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">Hooker's Commonplace Book records: "In 1565 John Wolcot was mayor. This mayor had passed all the offices towardes the mayroltie for about XXII yeres paste and by reason of his age and his small welthe it was not thought nor ment that ever the office of the mayroltie shold have fallen unto his lott. Nevertheless when the matter so fell out and no meanes founde how the same might be avoyded order was taken bothe that his howse shold be prepared and also he to be furnyshed with money for his dyet which lyberally the chamber dyd consyder. He was in tymes past a great merchant and adventured verie mich wherby he had greate welth but yn the ende his losses were so greate that he was verie poore and lyved yn very meane estate. He was a zelose man yn the Romyshe religion and to mich addicted unto papistrie. And in the commocion tyme when the commons of Devon and Cornwall wer yn rebellion and he was within the Citye the tyme of the beseging of the same yet his affection was suche towards theym that upon a daye when he as capteyn of the ward had the chardge of the westgate of this citie he went out at westgate to the rebells without any commyssion and had conferens with them which was not after forgotten but turned hym to dyspleasure." Maurice Levermore, who had been admitted freeman of the city in 1529 as John Wolcott's apprentice, was elected mayor of Exeter in 1564, the year prior to John's election. John was probably responsible for having Maurice appointed to the Common Council, and Maurice may have been instrumental in getting John selected as a candidate for mayor. John married Agnes ___. In 1553, John Wolcott, his wife, Agnes, and their son, Henry, were plaintiffs in a Chancery suit, filing suit against Sir Gawen Crowe, steward of the manor of Exminster, regarding a meadow that the Wolcotts held there.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(8) Elizabeth Wolcott, c.1520-. Elizabeth Ulcot married William Tuckfield at St. Petrox 1542, probably son or brother of John Tuckfield, Sheriff of Exeter 1547, mayor of Exeter 1549-50.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(8) Alice Wolcott, c. 1525-. Alice Ulcot married John Michael at St. Petrox in 1545.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(8) Henry Wolcott, c.1530-c.1575. In 1557, Henry Wolcote was admitted as a freeman of Exeter, by succession. This was done for a son whose father had been a freeman. Henry, may have lived with his father, for he seems to have moved from St. Petrox parish to St. Kerrian parish when his father did, as shown in the baptismal records of his nine children.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(9) John Wolcott, 1556-. John, son of Henry Wollcote, was baptized at St. Petrox 1556. John Woolcott, merchant, was admitted as a freeman of Exeter in 1584, having served as an apprentice to Alderman Thomas Martin, merchant. Most apprenticeships were for a period of seven years, so he probably began his apprenticeship in 1577. The tax rolls of 1584-5 show that John Wolcot, merchant, paid yearly 12d tax on a tenement in St. John Bows parish, once belonging to the Prior of Totnes and in 1584 in the possession of John Howell, the elder. John Howell's name appears on the subsidy rolls for St. John Bows parish in 1544, 1557, 1577, 1586 and 1593. In 1671, the "heirs of John Wolcott" still held one tenement in St. John Bows, "sometimes belonging to the Prior of Totnes, on the north side of High Street, being an inn, late in the possession of John Howell, rent 12d". This was probaby the inn known as the old "Totnes Tavern".
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(9) Alice, daughter of Henry Wollcote, baptized at St. Kerrian church 1558.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(9) Thomas, son of Henry Wollcote, baptized at St. Kerrian 1561.

</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(9) Hugh, son of Hary Wollcote, baptized at St. Kerrian 1570.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(9) Edward, son of Henry Wolcote, baptized at Exeter St. Paul parish in 1573. Edward Wollocott married Mary Courtis at Berry Pomeroy 1612. Edward Woolcott was buried at Exeter St. Paul's 1n 1666.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(10?) Edward Wolcott, c. 1600-c.1650; probably son of the above. Edward Wolcot married Grace Wilkins 1625 at Exeter St. Sidwell. The Protestation Return of 1641 lists Edward Woollcot at St. Sidwell. Grace was probably the Grace Wollacott who is listed on the subsidy roll of 1660 residing in Exeter St. Mary Stepps parish.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(11) William, son of Edward Wollcote, b. 1623 Exeter St. Mary Major.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(11) William, son of Edward Wolcot, baptized at St. Sidwell's 1630. William Wolcott is found on the hearth tax rolls for 1671 at St. Sidwell parish; m. (1) Sarah ____, m. (2) Joan Fawins 1688 Heavitree.

<div class="descendantDiv">(3?) Walter Wolcot of Walcot in the par. of Thruselton - Alicia d. & h. of Hugh Skerret of Chagford, 2 w., heads the Wolcott family in the 1620 Devon Visitation record. He is there said to have had two wives; by the first unnamed wife he is said to be the father of John, father of Joan Bidlake. This is shown to be in error in the earlier Wollocombe documents. By a second wife, Alice Skerrett, he is said to have been the father of John Woolcott of Chagford, who is said to have had 3 sons, John of Chudleigh, Richard, and Thomas. The Visitation bears the note that John Wolcott of Chudley, eldest son of John Wolcott of Chagford, and his son, John, "did commonly bear the arms of Skerret with his father's crest". The arms of Skerrett, given in the 1620 Visitation of Devon, was "or a chief indented sable".
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(4) John Wolcott of Chagford who for his good services in the warres had an addition give him to his armes, On chief or a lis entre two annulets. Such an addition to a coat of arms was called an "augmentation of honor" and was a rare distinction, usually given by the King, himself. This addition implies that John must have already been using a coat of arms. The presence of the fleur de lis on the augmentation suggests that this award was made for extraordinary service on the battlefields of France during the Hundred Years' War between 1440 and 1453 when the war ended. The 1620 Visitation of Devon gives a coat of arms: "Wolcot ? Ar. on a cross flory sa. 5 lis Or, the crest a faulcons hed arashed Ar. gutty Gu. quere", and "P. pale b. gu. on a cross florie Or 5 martletts Sa. le crest a griffins hed arashed Ar. gutty Gu. in the beck a fower de lis B. bezante. quere." The word "quere", or question, indicates that there was some question about this. The cross flory with 5 martlets was actually arms granted to Sir John Walcott of Leicester, who was no relation to the Devonshire Woolcotts.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">With the end of the wars in France, John Wolcott settled at Chagford, a stannary town which was a center for the tin trade. John's eldest son, John Wolcott of Chudleigh, was involved in this enterprise, so perhaps his father was also. John appears regularly in the Chagford Church Trustee records from 1480, when the records begin, until 1501. He was a trustee for lands of John Ebbsworthy in 1486, witnessed by John Wolcote or Morton Hampstead, tailor, and filed a charge of tresspass in 1489. In 1501, James Chudleigh, John Kyrton, and John Wolcote of Chagford granted land in the manor of Exborne to William Chudleigh. He may have been the John Wolcotte who, in 1502, serving as Coroner of the King in Devon, held an inquest at Plymouth into the death of Robert Matthew, Jr., fisherman. In 1521 John Wolcote, junior witnessed a document saying that in 1508 John Ebbysworthy granted land to Stephen Throwson in the manor of Southteign, except a close called Combe Parke and a meadow called Fossemead which John Wolcote holds, and John Ebbysworthy granted to John Wolcote of Exeter, senior, the reversion of that tenement with rent of &pound6 8s, to hold until 1535.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(5) John Wolcott of Chudleigh in his time his cousin Joan wife of Bidlake died & all her children died without issue. c.1430-1523. Chudleigh is a town about ten miles southeast of Chagford. About 1482 he married Margaret Bozom, a twice-widowed heiress with several children. By this marriage he became related to several prominent Devonshire families. Margaret and her sister, Elizabeth, were daughters and co-heiresses of John Bozom of Bozomhele and his wife, Jane Fortesque of Wood. John Bozom's sister, Joan, was the wife of Sir Henry Fortesque, Chief Justice of Common Pleas for Ireland. John Bozom's eldest daughter, Elizabeth, married Sir Baldwin Fulford, and, after his death, Sir William Hadesfield. Margaret Bozom, born about 1440, first married John Herte of Chudleigh and Bovey Tracy, by whom she had a son, John Herte. In 1475 she married Nicholas Southcott of Winkley in North Tawton, and had children, Thomas Southcott of Winkley, William Southcott of Chudleigh, Walter Southcott who became a priest, James Southcott who died young, and John Southcott of Indio in Bovey Tracy. Her son, Thomas Southcott married Margaret, daughter of Thomas Cole of Slade, the grandaughter of Thomasine Wolcott, above.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">John is called John Wolcott of Chudleigh in documents between 1495 and 1520, probably to distinguish him from other John Wolcotts, but he died at Exeter and was probably the John Wolcott who was admitted a freeman of the city of Exeter in 1481, described as a "gentleman". His name appears on the military survey of Exeter in 1522 residing in the parish of St. Mary Major. He may have also been the John Wolcote who was appointed a Justice of the Peace for Devon in 1514.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">The family's involvement in the tin mining trade of western Devonshire is shown in the records of the Stannary Courts that controlled this trade. In 1520 John Wolcot of Chudleigh is listed as one of the Jurates of the Stannary Court of Chagford, and in that year both he and his stepson, John Herte, paid taxes at the same court. Chagford was one of the four towns where tin miners could bring their metal for assay and stamping. Records for stamping duties paid in 1523, show that John Wolcott, presumably John of Chudleigh, John Wolcott of Pulbrooke, Peter Wolcott, John Herte, and John Southcott all paid tinning taxes at Chagford, and a John Wolcott paid the tax at Tavistock.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">John was involved in a number of Chancery proceedings regarding land disputes. The first of these occured about 1490, when Joan Teyngcomb, daughter and heiress of John Teygncomb of Teygncomb, brought suit against John Wolcote and others to obtain possession of houses and land at Chagford. Apparently the problem was not resolved, for again in 1505, Joan and her husband, John Wyll, and Joan's sister, Marjorie and her husband, Harry Barar, daughters of John Teyngcomb of Teyngcomb, brought suit against John Wolcote, John Wyll of Hill, and Michael Lackey, feoffees to uses in houses and land at Chagford. "Feoffees to uses" are trustees managing lands for another person or organization, such as a church. John was involved in another Chancery proceeding in 1495, when John Throwston, grandson of Thomas Throwston, took John Wolcote of Chudley and John Wyll, feoffees to use, again, in a house and land at Chagford, to court in a dispute over these lands. Richard Whyte took John Wolcott to Chancery court for detaining deeds to lands at Throwleigh about 1505, and Richard Forde appealed to the Chancery Court around 1520 to make John Wolcote give him the deeds to a house and lands at Chagford that John had wrongly detained. John became the plaitiff in another Chancery hearing which was held about 1510, when John Wolcote of Chudleigh took Richard Wykys, clerk, Robert Wythebroke, chaplain, and others to court for wrongful detention of deeds to a house and land at Stinial (Stenehalle) in Chagford.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">John died at Exeter in 1523, by which time he had accumulated substantial property, either through inheiritance from his father, marriage to Margaret Bozom, or from the tin trade. An inquest taken at Ashburton at the time of his death, states that John Wulcote, Senior, died at Exeter in 1523, and that John Wulcote, his son and heir, was age 42 years and more (b. c.1481). John died seized of five houses and 140 acres of land at Chagford, 20 acres of pasture in Southteign Manor at Chagford, three houses and 130 acres of land at Moreton Hampstead, 20 acres of land at Little Bovey, 4 acres of land at Newton Bushel in Highweek, a cottage with one acre of land at Chudleigh, 170 acres of land at Ashbury, 120 acres of land at Hollocomb Purramore in Winkley, a house with 120 acres of land at Exbourne, a house with 160 acres of land at Throughleigh, and a house with 100 acres of land at Hawkdown in Dowland.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(6) Alice, daughter of John Wolcot of Chudley married John Charles, son of William Charles of Morton Hampstead and his wife, Elizabeth Chaldon.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(6) John Wolcott of Chudley, 1480-1548; admitted freeman of the City of Exeter 1511; was a candidate in 1512 to represent Exeter in Parliament, but was defeated. He was probably the John Woolcott listed in Izacke's Antiquities as bayliff of the city of Exeter in 1516, for the John Wolcott who was later to be mayor of Exeter, was not admitted as a citizen of Exeter until the following year. In the military survey of 1522, John is listed residing in the parish of St. Mary Major, as is his father, and is described as "not ready for war", which might mean that he had some physical disability. He inheirited his father's property in 1524, and on the Subsidy Roll of 1524-5 he is shown as residing in Holy Trinity parish. His descendants continued to reside in Holy Trinity parish for several generations. The Subsidy Roll of 1544 lists him at Holy Trinity, and refers to him as "gent.".
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">In 1564, a survey was taken in Devon by the King's heralds, for the purpose of recording families' right to use coats of arms. This visitation records arms of "per pale azure and gules, a cross flory with 5 Cornish choughs proper, on a chief or, a fleur de lis between 2 annulets of the second", for John Wolcote of Exeter and wife Jane, daughter of John Foxley of Blakeslyn, Co. Northampton, parents of Thomas, and Katherine Wolcote. This is a variation of the arms recorded for his father.
In 1523, pardons were granted to John Wolcote of Exeter, and Joan, his wife, for having stolen &pound55 belonging to his father, John Wolcote, Sr., probably discovered right after the death of John's father. This was not John's only embarrassment. According to Chancery Proceedings for the period 1515-1529, John Ripley of Exeter, tailor, was refused bond by the Mayor and Bayliff of Exeter on an action of tresspass demanded by John Wolcott against Ripley and his wife, Joan, for hanging "a ram's horne in a rynge of the outer doore of the said John Wolcott to the defame & hurte of his name and honeste", damages being laid at &pound1000. John Wolcott agreed to abide by arbitration, whose award was fulfilled by Joan Ripley "in the parish church called Saint Marie the More within the said city personally knelying on both her kneyes bifore the sete where oon Johanne wife of the said John Wolcote most usually did sitte and asking the said Johanne Wolcote forgeveness". The ram's horn would have suggested cuckoldry.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">In 1541, John Woolcote, gent., sold to William Saxssen a house in Chudleigh in which William dwelt. This sale seems to end the family's connections with the village of Chudleigh. The deed for this sale mentions Thomas Woolcote, son and heir of John, who probably had to agree to the sale because the property was entailed. This was the only property named in the inquest taken at the death of John's father that did not descend to Thomas. An Inquisition Post Mortem was taken in 1549, shows that John left the lands inherited from his father, except the above house at Chudley, and also additional properties he had acquired: 2 tenements and 6 acres of meadow in Alphington; 1 tenement and 60 acres of pasture in Dawlish; 2 tenements, 6 acres of meadow and 100 acres of pasture at Doddiscombleigh; 40s annual rent from land at Cheriton; 1 messuage in Holsworthy; 13s 4d annual rent from land and tenements in Werrington; 13s 4d annual rent from land and tenements in Hatherleigh; 6s 8d annual rent from land and tenements in High Bickington; 1 messuage, 6 acres of meadow and 70 acres of pasture in Nymet Roland; 2 acres of meadow in Bow and 1 tenement, 10 acres of meadow and 50 acres of pasture in Witheridge. John had nearly doubled the property that his father had left him. The Inquisition Post Mortem taken at his death says that he died 2 Edw 6, and that his son, Thomas Wolcote, was 34 years of age and more at the time of his father's death.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(7) Thomas Wolcott of Southcott, 1515-1555; married Jane Wrey about 1548. Thomas Wolcote was Justice of the Peace in 1550-1551, and was a member of the Subsidy Commission in 1553. Thomas Wolcote, gent., was on a list of the people who paid annuities to Simon Rede, the last abbot of Tor Abbey. Thomas died in 1555. At the time of his death he held most of the property that his father and grandfather had held. According to an Inquisition Post Mortem taken at the time of his death, Thomas held: 10 messuages, 40 acres of meadow, and 200 acres of pasture at Chagford; 1 messuage, 10 acres of meadow and 100 acres at Fen and Kenworthy in Chagford; 2 tenements and 6 acres of meadow in Newton Bushel; ½ of a messuage, 4 acres of meadow and 40 acres of pasture at Ashbury; ½ of a messuage, 6 acres of meadow and 60 acres of pasture at Winkleigh Keynes; 2 messuages, 20 acres of land, and 100 acres of pasture at Exbourne; 2 messuages, 20 acres of meadow, and 80 acres of pasture at Dowland; 2 tenements and 6 acres of meadow in Alphington; 2 tenements with 20 acres of pasture in Dawlish; 2 tenements, 6 acres of meadow, and 100 acres of pasture at Doddiscomb; 1 messuage in Holsworthy; 13s 4d annual rent from land and tenements at Werrington; 13s 4d annual rent from land and tenements in Hatherleigh; 6s 8d annual rent from land and tenements in High Bickington; 1 messuage, 6 acres of meadow and 70 acres of pasture at Nymet Rowland; 2 acres of meadow at Bow; and 1 tenement, 10 acres of meadow, and 50 acres of pasture at Witheridge. The properties that his father had left him at Moreton Hampstead, Throwleigh and Cheriton had been disposed of, but Thomas had acquired an additional tenement with 4 acres of meadow and 40 acres of pasture at Shapleigh Hilling in Chagford; 10s annual rent from land and tenements at Barchworthy in Chagford; 42s 6d annual rent from land and tenements at Hurston in Chagford; and 2s 4d annual rent from land at Willhead in Chagford. The inquest makes no mention of land held at Exeter, a free city apparently excluded from the Crown's purview. A document dated 1576, however, sets forth the boundaries of lands which funded Exeter charities. One of these pieces of land, located in St. Sidwell parish, is described as being bounded on one side by Thomas Woolcote's land. Following Thomas' death, his widow married Robert Fry, son of William Fry of Yerty. They apparently lived in the Wolcott house in Holy Trinity parish, for Robert Fry paid a tax on land valued at &pound10 per year in Holy Trinity in 1557. The second half of the subsidy was collected later that year, and this time Robert paid a tax on land valued at &pound3 per year, and his name is followed by that of his stepson, Peter Wolcott, who had come of age.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(8) Peter Wolcott, 1539-c.1605. This may be the Peter Wulcote mentioned in the South Tawton Court Rolls of 1572. In 1577 and 1581 Peter paid a tax on land in Holy Trinity parish valued at &pound5 per year. The tax rolls for Exeter for 1584 state that Peter Wolcot paid a tax of 22d on the barbigan within the walls, between the Southgate and the tenement next to the watergate built by Geoffrey Thomas in Holy Trinity parish. This was later crossed out and the inscription added, "The heirs of Wolcott hold the barbigan on the West of Southgate at 16d tax". A barbigan is a defensive tower built into a gate or bridge, and apparently the Wolcott's Exeter residence was built into this tower. This same tax roll states that Peter Wolcot and Edward Wolcot held land in St Mary More parish in Exeter. In 1584, Peter Wolcot was one of a number of prominent citizens of Exeter who signed a document entitled "The Exeter Bond of Association for the Protection of Queen Elizabeth"' indicating that Peter was of the Protestant faith. On the Subsidy Roll of 1586, Peter Woolcott paid a tax on land in Holy Trinity valued at &pound4 per year, and in 1593, Mr. Peter Wollcote was taxed on land with the same value in the same parish. Then, in 1602, Peter Wolcott, gent., paid a tax of 5s 4d on land in Holy Trinity valued at &pound4 per annum and Edward Wolcott, gent., paid the tax on land in the same parish valued at &pound2. Peter married Alice Mitchell, daughter of John Mitchell of Truro, Cornwall. The Visitation of Devonshire of 1620 gives only the name of his son, John, but he had a number of other children.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(9) Dorothy, b. c.1580 Exeter; m. Thomas Drew 1604 at Wolborow and Newton Abbot. Thomas Drew of Exeter registered his family pedigree in the 1620 Visitation of Devon. In it he stated that he had married Dorothy, daughter of Peter Wolcott of Exeter, and by her had children, Henry age 8, Thomas, George and Susan. Thomas Drew was the son of John Drew of St. Leonards, and Susan, daughter and co-heiress of John Gaverick of Ford, who were married at Wolborough and Newton Abbott in 1573. Their son, Thomas Drew, Jr., is thought to have been the Thomas Drew that immigrated to Virginia and was at Charles City in 1650. His will mentioned his daughter, Dorothy, and brother, George. Dorothy married Capt. Hubert Farrell in Virginia. The same parish records show that just a month earlier in 1604, Elizabeth Drew, apparently Thomas Drew's sister, had married a Simon Wolcott. Elizabeth was the widow of William Strode, whom she had married at Wolborough and Newton Abbot in 1601. Simon must have been related to Dorothy, possibly the son of her uncle, Edward.

A memorial tablet in the Huxam church reads, "The remains of Dorothy Wolcott wife of John Wolcott gent. The lady was the daughter of Giles Bampfield esq. and paid the debt of nature on 5 Nov 1617". Giles enrolled at Oxford University in 1582, age 14, son of a cleric, probably Robert Bampfield, rector of Ashington 1571-74. John Wolcott then married Joan Headland at Alphington in 1619. Either John or his son signed the 1641 Protestation Return at Alphington

<div class="descendantDiv">(9?) William Wolcott, b. 1597 Exeter, d. 1646 Sidbury, Devon. Burke's Landed Gentry, gives a genealogy of the Wolcott family of Sidbury. The pedigree is registered at theBritish College of Arms and says that this family was descended from Peter Wolcott, son of John Wolcott of Chudley, who had a son, William, who settled at Sidbury. If William was, indeed, a son of a Peter Wolcott, it is more likely that he was Peter, the grandson of John Wolcott of Chudleigh. Records of Exeter College, Oxford University, say that William Wolcot of Devon, pleb., graduated in 1615, age 18; born, therefore, in 1597. William Woolcott of Sidford, gent, and William his son held "ye Gardunio" in Sidford for 60 years. He purchased the property caled Minkcombe at Sidbury. He was a churchwarden at Sidbury in 1623. In 1646, probate of William's will was granted to his widow, Laurell, with William named as his father's son and heir. He appears to have been the senior descendant in the male line from John Wolcott of Chagford; m. Laurell Street of Dartmouth 1618 Exeter.

Chancery proceedings say that William Woolcott of Sidford, gent., and William, his son, had held the premises known as "ye Gardonio" in Sidford, and that Sir John Pole, bart., had claimed a right of way through the Wolcott's garden to his dwelling house. The Wolcotts said that they had held the land for 60 years and more, and had paid the fines and heriots to the old lord of the manor, and that there were witnesses to this, but they were old and unable to travel to the assize. Sir John Pole claimed that the Wolcotts had not held the land for 60 years, and if they had, they shouldn't have for the land was common land belonging to the manor of Stone. He had instructed his steward to find out if John Lide had driven his cattle across the land, and when Lide had admitted that this was so, Sir John began driving his horses and carriages over it, until the Wolcotts stopped up the road.

<div class="descendantDiv">(11) Rev. Maximillian Wolcott, c. 1645-1720. Maximilliam Woolcott of Sidbury was a student at Exeter College, Oxford, in 1661. Maximillian received his BA degree from Oxford in 1665, and was rector at Cotleigh from 1689 to 1720 and rector at Feniton from 1690 to 1720. He married Susanna Churchill, daughter of Rev. Charles Churchill, his predecessor at Feniton in 1675. Maximillian died at Feniton in 1720, and was succeeded as rector of Cotleigh by his cousin's son, Maximillian Woolcott.

<div class="descendantDiv">(11) John, son of John Wolcott, b. 1660 Colyton. John's grandfather, Thomas Holmes, died on 1670. In his will, Thomas Holmes of Colyton, merchant, left 10 shillings to his son-in-law, John Wolcott, to buy a ring "and in full satisfaction of my daughters portion", and "one close of freelande called Gatcombe which I give to my dear grandson John Wollcott". John was a freeholder at Sidbury 1715-1766, and churchwarden at Sidbury in 1716 and 1720; freeholder at Salcomb Regis 1747-1450. In 1748 Jane and Charles Chichester, deeded to John Woolcott of Sidbury, gent., a messuage called Bossell, in the manor of Mincome, in trust for Maximilliam Woolcott the younger of Sidbury, gent., for &pound250; m.

</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(8) Edward Wolcott, c.1545-. The 1584 Exeter tax roll states that Peter Wolcot and Edward Wolcot held land in St Mary More parish in Exeter. Then, in 1602, Peter Wolcott, gent., paid a tax of 5s 4d on land in Holy Trinity valued at &pound4 per annum and Edward Wolcott, gent., paid the tax on land in the same parish valued at &pound2. Edward was apparently Peter's younger brother.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(9?) Simon Wolcott, c.1580-. In 1604 Simon Wolcott married Elizabeth Drew, the sister of Thomas Drew who married Peter Wolcott's daughter, Dorothy, a month later of the same year. Simon was probably not Peter's son, for John born in 1594 was Peter's heir, so Simon may have been the son of Peter's brother, Edward. The will of Hercules Pyne of Axmouth, gent., dated 1610, printed in Devonshire Wills, leaves bequests to his sisters-in-law, Alice Young, Ellen (Helen) Snow and Elizabeth Woollcott, to his brother-in-law John Young, and to his cousin, Walter Young. Hercules was married to Margery, daughter of John Young of Axminster, MP for Plymouth. None of his brothers married an Elizabeth, and his wife had no sister, Elizabeth. Elizabeth must have been the widow of Margery's eldest brother, Walter Young, who married Elizabeth Drew.

<div class="descendantDiv">(8?) William Wolcott lived in Holy Trinity parish at Exeter and was a contemporary of Peter and Edward. He may have been their younger brother. William Walcot married Anstis Smith, his second wife, in 1587 at Exeter Holy Trinity. Anstice Wolcott married John Pallens in 1602. William must have died about 1600.

<div class="descendantDiv">(7) Catherine, c.1525-; m. John Wood 1546 Holy Trinity Church, Exeter. The 1620 Visitation shows that John Wood, son of Edmund Wood of Orchard in Lewtrenchard, and his wife, Jane Franklyn of Tudlake, married Catherine, daughter of John Wolcott of Exeter and had five children, Thomas, William, Elizabeth, Alice and Phillipa. John Wood died in 1586.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(5) Richard Wolecot 2 filius, b. c.1430, is recorded as second son of John of Chagford in the Visitation of 1620. Richard Wolecote was churchwarden at Chagford 1481 and 1495. Richard's descendants lived at Lustleigh and Hennock, and apparently also at Bridford, three adjacent parishes. Hennock is 4 miles east of Lustleigh, and Bridford 4 miles north of Hennock.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(6) John Wolcote de Lisleigh, b. c.1450. Described in the 1620 Visitation as "John of Listleigh, married "Maude relicta Wi. Wescote of Wescote in North Tawton". Maude was the widow of William Westcote of Westcote in North Tawton, a village 8 miles northeast of Okehampton. A Chancery proceeding concerning John and Maude Wolcott was addressed to the Lord Chancellor Archbishop of York. This can only refer to George Neville who was Chancellor and Archbishop of York in 1465-7 and in 1470-1, making John born 1450 or before. In the Chancery Proceeding, John Woolcote and Maude, his wife, late the wife of William Westcote, state that William Westcote died enfeeoffed of two messuages, 100 acres of heath land, 12 acres of meadow, 4 acres of wood, and twenty acres of furse and heath at Withecomb and Westcote, and that William Westcote had enfeeoffed the land to Thomas Throwston and Simon Whyddon of Chagford as an estate for the said William and Maude and the heirs of their bodies, and that Thomas and Simon had refused to give the land to John and Maude Woolcote when they requested it. Thomas and Simon replied that the 100 acres was arrable land, not heath land, and that William Westcote's intent, expressed in his last will, was that his wife, Maude, should receive the proceeds of the land until the time that Joan, daughter and heiress of William Westcote, should come of age, at which time the land was to be given to Joan and her heirs. They had allowed Maude the proceeds of the land, but would not give the land to her and her husband, John Wolcott.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(7) Richard Wolecote filius et haeres Johis, c.1475-c.1520. Julian Wolcott who died at Staverton in 1524 was apparently his sister. Richard's son, Gregory Wolcott was at Lustleigh in 1524 and took over the property of Julian at Staverton in 1525.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(8) Peter Wolcote of Lisley purchased Buterstowe in Hemiock, c.1495-c.1540. An entry in the records of Wreyland Manor for 1501 says that Peter Wolcote was with Thomas Wolcote, out of the King's assize. Wreyland manor was mostly within the parish of Bovey Tracy, but the inhabitants of the manor were often registered in the neighboring parish of Lustleigh. The King's assize was a legal hearing for such matters as criminal cases and land ownerships disputes. This Peter is the only known Peter living in 1501, and he was definately a minor, so it appears that the assize may have been hearing an inheiritance dispute in which Peter was involved, and that Peter was then living with Thomas Wolcott. It seems likely that Peter's father, Richard Wolcott, died in that year and that Thomas was acting as his guardian. Unfortunately the Wreyland Manor records end in 1501. The Visitation of 1620 states that Peter Wolcot of Lustleigh purchased Buterstowe in Hennock, a village 2 miles north of Bovey Tracy. In 1524 Peter was listed on the subsidy rolls as living at Lustleigh.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(9) John Wolcott of Buttorstowe, c.1525-c.1585; m. Joan. On the military muster roll of 1569, John Wolcott is listed as a presenter at Hennock, one who made a deposition on behalf of the parish. John deposed that everyone presented in the parish came under the jurisdiction of the tinners court of Chagford, indicating that he may have been involved in the tin trade. In 1573, John Wolcot of Henycke, yeoman, purchased land at Bovey Tracy from Edward Collyns, merchant, of Great Totnes. Richard Wolcot, possibly John's uncle, is mentioned in this deed. The tax rolls of 1581 show John Wolcott, Sr. of Hennock assessed on &pound10 of goods, and John Wolcott, Jr. assessed on &pound5 of goods.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(10) John, son of John Wulcote, b. 1548 at Hennock; apparently died young.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(10) Richarda, daughter of John Wulcote b. 1550 Hennock; m. Richard Laye at Hennock in 1572. Parish records at Bovey Tracy show that a Richarda Laye married William Bound in 1583, probably Richarda Wolcott's second marriage. In 1603 there was a dispute over the will of Joan Woolcott of Salcombe Regis, a village 2 miles southeast of Sidmouth, between her daughter Richarda Sweete and John Wolcott. This must have been Richarda's third marriage. Her nephew, Hugh Wolcott, married Agnes Sweet about 1597.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(10) John Wolecote of Boterstow, son of John Wolcott, b. 1553 Hennock, d. c.1612. John, Jr. is listed on the Hennock tax rolls of 1581. Hooker's list of the "Principal Gentry of Queen Elizabeth's Time", states, "Hennock; in this parish dwelleth Wolcott of Buttor", the only Wolcotts named on this list. John probably married Joan, for Joan Wolcott, widow, in named in a suit brought by John's grandchildren Peter Wolcott and his sister Joan some time between 1612 and 1633. In this suit Joan was awarded the house in Hennock in which Joan Wolcott, widow, then resided. John inheirited Buttor from his father. In 1602, Anne Blackslade, servant of John Wolcott, was buried at Hennock. John died about 1612, after apparently having dissipated much of his wealth.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(11) Hugh, son of John Wolcote, b. 1576 at Hennock, d. c.1640; m. Agnes Sweet c.1597. Agnes was the daughter of John Sweet of Traine, in Modbury, and his wife, Margaret Perriam. Margaret Perriam was from an influential family. Her father was mayor of Exeter in 1563 and 1572, and her brothers were Sir William Perriam (1534-1604), Lord Chief Justice of England, Lord Chief Baron of the Exchecquer, and MP for Plymouth in 1563, and Sir John Perriam. Hugh Wolcott was churchwarden at Hennock in 1602, and moved to Bovey Tracy about 1604. Hugh's wife, Agnes, was buried at Bovey Tracy in 1635. Debts incurred by John Wolcott and his son, Hugh, form the basis of several legal disputes brought by Hugh's son, Peter, against George Cruse, who had been the executor of the will of Hugh's father-in-law, John Sweet, who died in 1613.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(12) Peter, son of Hugh Woolcott, b. 1600 Hennock, d.1655. William Hore and his wife and Bartholomew Gale and his wife loaned money to Peter in 1626 to buy lands at Bovey Tracy. Both of these couples were Peter's aunts and uncles. In 1641 Peter Wolcott signed the Protestation Return at Bovey Tracy. Peter's will, dated and proved 1655, requests he be buried in the churchyard at Bovey Tracy; leaves 10 shillings to the poor of Bovey Tracy; gives to Bartholomew Wollcot, his brother, his house and appurtenances and for default of issue the said land to go to Elizabeth Prigg the eldest daughter of Henry Prigge of Exeter, woolen draper; to the said Bartholomew Wollcot &pound4 yearly to be paid out of the rents of his lands; to Bartholomew Wollcot or Agnes Wollcott his daughter the sum of &pound10 which is in full satisfaction of all debts; to Joan Geale my kinswoman &pound10; to the foresaid Elizabeth Prigge all his lands in Bovitracy Henniocke Ilsington and Ogwell except the house bequeathed to Bartholomew Wollcott, and if Elizabeth have no issue, it was to go to her sister, Mary Prigge, and then to her brother, Joshua Prigge, then to Margery and then to the heirs of the said Peter Wollcot; to Mary Curtis of Bovitracy one silver spoon and 10 shillings; and the remainder to Elizabeth Prigg with Henry Prigg as overseer.

</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(9) Peter, c.1530-1615. The Visitation of 1620 states that Peter Wolcott of Lustleigh was the father of both John Wolcott of Hennock, and of John Wolcott of Mowston als. Moreston in Haberton, his second son. This must be in error, for the first Wolcott known to be at Halberton was named Peter. The land called Morston, or Morston Barton had been owned by the Sydenham and Windham families, and must have been obtained from them. In 1565, Peter Woulcote of Halberton, yeoman, purchased a moiety of a tenement in Halberton called Lake, in the tenure of Phillip Berye, from John Prouse of Combe Martin, esq. Peter Wolcotte is listed on the 1569 Halberton muster rolls as providing 1 corslet, 1 pike, 1 bow, 1 sheaf of arrows, and 1 steel cap, an as serving as a billman. Peter Wulcott was at the South Tawton Manor Court in 1572. Peter Wolcott served as churchwarden at Halberton in 1584, and in 1591 he paid for his wife's grave. Overseer of the will of brother-in-law Thomas Tanner in 1589.

</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(10) Hugh, 1566-1643. Hugh Wolcott of Halberton appears to have been Peter's eldest son, born in 1566. In 1583, Hugh Woolcott, age 17, graduated from Exeter College, Oxford University. University records state that his father was a gentleman. A coat of arms, designated "Wolcott of Oxford", was probably used by him. In 1598, a license to marry was granted to Hugh Woolcott of Halberton, gent., and Jocust Hyscombe of Exeter, widow. Hugh Wolcott served as a churchwarden at Halberton in 1602. In 1620, Hugh Woolcott of Halberton attempted to register his family pedigree at the Herald's Visitation. The records state that he was disclaimed at Tiverton, that is he was not allowed to register a coat of arms, even though his relative, John Wolcott of High Bickington, was allowed to register a pedigree that included Hugh's grandfather. Joice, wife of Hugh Wolcott, was buried at Halberton in 1628, and Hugh paid for her grave in the church. Hugh Woolcott, gent., was buried at Halberton in 1643. The name of Hugh Wolcott, gent., of Moreston, Halberton, is recorded in the Protestation Returns of 1641, as is the name of Abraham Wolcott, who may have been his son.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(11) Abraham, c. 1600. Abraham Woolcott married Mary Stone at Halberton 1638. His name appears on the Protestation Return of 1641.

</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(10) Alexander Woolcott, b. c.1577, d. 1653 Kingsbridge, Devon, merchant. Alexander Ulcott who paid for Peter Wolcott's burial in 1615 at Halberton was probably Alexander Wolcott of Kingsbridge. Alexander Wolcott of Kingsbridge, merchant, and his son, Alexander, were cofeeofees in land at Kingsbridge in 1601 and 1626. In 1622 he leased land in Churchstow Manor and Norten for the lives of Alexander, John and Thomas Wolcote his sons. In 1639 he leased 9 acres in Churchstow Manor for the lives of his children, Alexander, John and Joyce. Alexander Woolcot, merchant, John Lapp, and John Kendall, all of Kingsbridge, were co-feeofees of all the land belonging to the town and parish of Kingsbridge, in 1626. In another Chancery proceeding, Alexander Wolcott was the spokesperson for the town of Kingsbridge in a dispute over the ownership of land at Kingsbridge. The townspeople claimed that the mill had been built on town property. John Wolcott was also named in this case as one of the townspeople who supported this claim; m. Jane ____. Jane, wife of Alexander Woolcott, Sr., died 1636 Dodbrooke. Alexander Wolcott the elder of Kingsbridge, in his 1635 will, gave poor of Kingsbridge 40s; grandson Samuel Wolcott 40s, grandchildren John, Jane and Thomas Wolcott 40s each, cousin Dorothy Newman 20s, maidservant Agnes 5s, Daniel Hodge at end of his apprenticeship 5s, wife Jane goods during life or widowhood she to maintain my son John and his wife and children and one servant with food and lodging in the house where I now dwell if they behave, if not she can put them out,

</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(11) Alexander Wolcott Jr., c.1602-1636 Kingsbridge; married Elizabeth Pearse 1633 at Exeter. In 1636, following the death of her husband, Elizabeth brought suit against her father-in-law, claiming that when she married Alexander Wolcott, Jr., in 1633, an agreement was made with her father, John Pearse of Exeter, merchant, to pay Alexander Wolcott, Sr., &pound300 in money, for which Alexander was to settle on the young couple his shop, warehouse, rooms and cellars, and all his mercery, silk goods, grocery, haberdashery and drapery. He and his wife, Jane, were to provide meat, drink, and lodging for the couple and their children, a man servant and a maid servant, and fodder for one horse. If the young couple, or Elizabeth, if a widow and unmarried, chose to move from the house of Alexander, the elder, he was to pay them an annuity of &pound30 in quarterly installments. The &pound300 was paid and the marriage agreement signed in 1634. Elizabeth stated that before she had been married a quarter of a year, Alexander, Sr., and his wife, Jane, moved out and left the young couple to fend for themselves. She said that Alexander, Sr., had forced them to buy household goods from him at inflated prices, and to buy stock in the store for &pound720, when it was only worth &pound600. Alexander, Jr., borrowed &pound300 from John Pearse for this purpose, and paid the rest in installments. She stated that Alexander, Sr., had never paid them the &pound30 annuity, meddled in the business, and sold their stock and kept the money. Alexander, Jr., died intestate and Elizabeth, his executrix, was willing to pay his debts, but due to a conspiracy between Alexander Wolcott, Sr. and others, she was dunned for debts of more that &pound1000. The stock in the store is valued at &pound410 and her personal goods at &pound70, so she has offered her creditors a composition for the debts by which they would get a portion of their demands, but they refuse to accept this. Also Alexander, Sr., owns a bakehouse and land called Cattispath in Kingsbridge which should have come to the young couple under the marriage agreement, but from which he continues to take the profits of &pound20 per annum. Elizabeth requests this money, plus the arears of the &pound30, and requests that the creditors make a realistic account of Alexander. Jr.'s, debts. The creditors presented their accounts, most of &pound20 to &pound30 and long in arrears. John Pearse confirmed his daughter's story but still requested the &pound31 due him. Alexander Wolcott, Sr., stated that the property was to go to his son, Alexander, after the decease of Alexander, Sr., and Jane, his wife, and was worth &pound1000. The bakehouse had been intended for his son, John, but Alexander, Jr., had asked that it be included in his portion, in return for which Alexander Jr. would pay John &pound100 at the time of his father and mother's death. This property was to remain his parent's until their death. He said that he and his wife, Jane, had wished to live peaceably with the young couple, but had been forced to depart by the dissolute, disobedient and violent course that Elizabeth led Alexander, Jr., into. He beat the father's servants and threatened his father or anyone else who came into the kitchen to "thrust him through the cheeks" with a pronged staff he had, and refused to eat at the same table with his parents. In the interest of peace, Alexander and Jane moved out. The &pound30 was not due unless Alexander, Jr., and Elizabeth moved from the shop premises, which Elizabeth had just done in 1636. Alexander and Elizabeth had kept a large portion of his father's household stuff, and had certainly never bought any of it. The shop goods were meant to have gone to Alexander, Jr., at a fair valuation and Alexander, Jr., had agreed that they were worth &pound50 more than the &pound720 they had valued them at. The &pound300 from John Pearce had gone toward the purchase of the goods, but the &pound420 balance had never been paid. Alexander said he had tried to assist his son with the store and had sold &pound200 of goods and had given it all to his son. Elizabeth was not admitting the full value of the goods currently in stock in order to avoid payment of her debts. In 1638 Elizabeth Wolcott, widow, brought suit against John Wolcott and Elizabeth, his wife, claiming the household goods due her under her marriage settlement. She stated that Alexander, Jr., had been forced by his father to take out a bond of &pound420, which he had repaid by installments. She claimed that Alexander, Sr., had given most of his household goods to his second son, John. John was named executor of his father's estate, valued at about &pound1000, and was holding the household goods, worth &pound300 or more, and demanding full payment of the &pound420 bond. John Wolcott responded saying that his father had never taken anything that wasn't his. All his household goods were worth no more than &pound60. His father was a very poor man with a mean estate, scarcely enough to pay his debts. He had been impoverished and his credit ruined by the bad behavior and poor business sense of his eldest son, Alexander, Jr., to the ruin of John's own prospects. Their father's death had been hastened by all this worry. John said that he would give his sister-in-law her household goods when she paid what she owed him. In 1639, the household items were divided between John and Elizabeth, with John receiving the larger portion.

<div class="descendantDiv">(8?) Richard Wolcott of Staverton, c. 1500-c.1560?, probably a brother of Peter of Lustleigh. In 1524 and 1525, the names of several Wolcotts appear on the Lay Subsidy Roll for Staverton: Richard Wolcote, taxed on goods valued at &pound2 1/3 per year; Julian Wolcote, taxed on goods valued at &pound2 per year in 1524, but whose name is replaced by the name of Gregory Wolcote in 1525, with goods also valued at &pound2 per year. Gregory was at Lustleigh in 1524 and was probably related to Peter Wolcott of Lustleigh. At this time Julian was a woman's name. It seems likely that Julian was the widowed mother of Richard and Gregory.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(9?) Thomas Wolcott, c. 1530-. Two Wolcotts appear at Staverton on the Muster Roll of 1569. Both Thomas Wolcot and Ellice Wolcaut are listed to serve as harquibusiers. An Alice Wolcott is listed at Staverton on the Subsidy Roll of 1588, paying a tax of 7 shillings, possibly a misreading of Ellice.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(9?) Ellice Wolcott, c. 1530-.

<div class="descendantDiv">(8) Gregory Wolcott, c.1500-c.1560. The Wolcotts of Bridford, a village 6 miles north of Lustleigh, seem to be descended from Gregory Wolcott, who may have been another younger brother of Peter. Peter and Gregory were living at Lustleigh in 1524, according to the Lay Subsidy roll of that year, and the following year, 1525, Gregory's name is listed at Staverton, where it replaced the name of Julian who was listed there in 1524. Presumably Julian had died and Gregory took over her property. It seems likely that she had been his mother. Gregory's name next appears in the Bridford parish records. Gregory Wollacote paid a tax on &pound15 on the 1543-5 Subsidy Roll.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(0) John Wolcott, c.1530-1614. John Wolcott of Bridford was probably Gregory's eldest son, baptized before the parish registers begin in 1537, although Gregory also had another younger son with the name of John. There may have even been two Gregories, father and son, for otherwise Gregory's youngest child would have been born when he was 62 years old. John Wolcott of Bridford is listed on the military muster roll of 1569 as a pikeman, and in 1581 John Woulcot of Bridford was assessed taxes on &pound3 of goods. He is probably the John Woolcot, Sr. of Bridford whose will was proved at the Exeter Principal Probate Registry in 1614.

</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(5) Thomas Wolcott, c.1455-c.1520. The Wreyland Manor records show that in 1501 Peter Wolcott, presumably the Peter of Lustleigh listed in the 1620 Visitation, was "with Thomas Wolcott out of the king's assize", that is, not registered in frankpledge. Thomas appears to have been his guardian after the death of Peter's father, Richard Wolcott, and must have been a close relative. Thomas was probably a younger son of Richard Wolcott of Lustleigh. Wrey Manor, later called Wreyland Manor, was located mostly in the parish of Bovey Tracy, but was directly across the Wrey River from the village of Lustleigh. In 1497, John, Lord Dynham, was lord of Wrey Manor, which then consisted of 200 acres divided into nine "messuages", or farms, which were all leased to tenants. Thomas Wolcotts' name is found in the surviving records of this manor that cover the last quarter of the fifteenth century. In the Wreyland manorial accounts we find a record of a Thomas Wollecote taking up tenancy in land there in 1480. At the manor court held in 1480, the tithingman presented that "Henry Wreyford who held of the lord of the manor according to the custom of the manor a tenement and a close of land has died since the last court whereby two cows worth thirteen shillings and four pence have fallen to the lord of the manor as a heriot, and the tenement is sufficiently in repair. And hereupon came Thomas Wollecote and prayed that he should be admitted to be a tenant of the manor for the tenement and close aforesaid by virtue of his copy of Court Roll which he produces, the date of which is Monday the seventeenth day of January in the nineteenth year of the reign of King Edward the Dourth, and so he was admitted as a tenant and did his fealty to the lord of the manor." Thomas may have been related to Henry Wreyford whose property he took over. One of the Wreyfords registered their family pedigree in the Visitation of 1620, beginning with John Wreyford of Hennock and his sons, Roger of Hennock b.1465, Peter b. 1468, and John b. 1470. It is of interest that the family crest of the Wreyford family was "a griffin's head erased", similar to the crest used by the Wolcott family, and that the name, Peter, is first found in the Wolcott family in Peter of Lustleigh, born about 1490. Thomas' land is believed to be the farm referred to as Forder Wreyford or Lower Wreyford, and was located next to the ford over the river. Part of this land was later called "Milland" because it was located on the Wrey River, adjascent to Lustleigh mill. Thomas Wolcott's name appears quite often in the manorial accounts. At the court held in 1481, the tithingman presented that "Thomas Wolcote has made a brew of ale and thereby broken the assize; therefore he is at mercy; three pence." At the next assize, heldin 1481, the tithingman presented that "Thomas Wolcote has made an assault on Peter Wilmede with a pole against the peace; therefore is he in mercy; three pence. And that the same Thomas has made an assault on the same Peter with a pole against the peace; therefore he is at mercy; three pence. And that the same Thomas has made an assault on the same peter with a plank against the peace; therefore he is at mercy; three pence. Altogether, nine pence. Let him be distrained. He has tendered the money." Peter Wilmede held the tenement called Wreyford, located next to Thomas' home at Forder Wreyford. He died in 1482, hopefully not as a result of Thomas' beatings. At the manor court held in 1482, Thomas was again cited for making ale and was fined three pence. Nevertheless, he was appointed reeve for the following year. Thomas Ollesbrome took over the tenement called Wreyford in 1483. At the court held 1484, the tithingman presented that "Thomas Wolcote has made an assault on John Walling with a stone against the peace; therefore he is mercy; three pence." Thomas turns up again in the court held in 1489. The tithingman presented that "Thomas Wolcote, Thomas Ollesbrome, and Thomas Merdon have permitted the Rive Wrey to be choked up with gravel and timber to the anusance of the country; therefore they are in mercy, one penny each. They have repaired it." "Also he presents that Thomas Wolcote has made an assault on Joan Merdon with a switch against the peace; therefore he is in mercy; three pence. And let him be distrained." At the courts held in 1489, 1490, 1492, 1493, 1494, 1495, and 1496, Thomas Wolcote again paid three pence each for brewing ale. At the May 1493 court he was sworn in as reeve and tithingman for the coming year. At the court held in 1495, "the tithingman comes there and presents that John Boudon has made an assault on Thomas Wollecote with a hanger against the peace and has drawn blood. Therefore he is in mercy; nine pence. He has tendered the money. And that Thomas Wollecote has made an assault on John Boudon with a staff against the peace and has drawn blood. Therefore he is in mercy; nine pence. He has tendered the money." At the same court, "Thomas Wolcote complains of Thomas Ollesbrome in a plea of trespass in two complaints…that he did not accept twenty bushels of apples at Northmyllehill as is imputed to him. William Gold is his pledge for three mark. Issue: that he did kill his pig at Wreyford as is imputed to him. William Gold is his pledge for three mark." Apparently some sort of a deal was worked out, for at the next court held in 1496, John Ollesbrome claimed that he did accept twenty bushels of apples at Northmyllehille and did not kill Thomas Wollecote's pig, and that Thomas' complaint was false. At the same court, John Wollecote, Thomas' son, requested and was given the reversion of Ollesbrome's tenement "when they shall have fallen in through the aforesaid Thomas' death or surrender." The following court held in 1496, held that "Thomas Wollecote is in mercy for his false complaint against Thomas Ollesbrome in a plea of trespass whereon there was an issue," and Thomas Ollmesbrome surrendered his tenement to the lord of the manor and it was granted to John Wolcott. John Ollesbrome moved out of the manor, and Thomas Wolcott had his son, John, as a neighbor instead. After this, other than a few more fines for brewing without a license, Thomas seems to have kept the peace. An entry for 1501 says that Peter Wolcote was with Thomas Wolcote, out of the King's assize. This sounds as if Thomas was then serving as foster father for Peter Wolcott of Lustleigh. Unfortunately the Wreyland Manor records end at this point.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(6) John, c.1476-1554. The names of other Wolcotts begin to appear toward the end of the Wreyland Manor records. In 1488 John Wolcote was assigned with John Merdon as a pledge. This refers to the system of frankpledge, where adult males were assigned to a group who were held responsible for each other's good behavior. Men were usually assigned to such a group when they were about twelve or thirteen years old, so John was probably born about 1476. This was the right age to have been a son of Thomas. John took over the tenement called Wreyford, located next to his father's tenement, in 1496. He would have then been 20years old. Wreyland Manor records for 1501 show that both John Wolcott and Thomas Wolcott were fined for making ale, indicating that John was then considered an independent adult and not Thomas' dependant, so this was probably the John who was in frankpledge in 1488. Unfortunately, he records of Wreyland Manor terminate in 1502. This is apparently the same John, described as "of Pullobrook" that paid a tinning tax at Ashburton in 1523. Asburton is one of the four stannary towns where such tax was paid, so he was apparently involved in the tin trade in that area. Pullobrook is farm in the parish of Bovey Tracy, a few miles from Wreyland. Pullobrook is mentioned in Domesday. The name is derived from its location on Yarrow Brook and the Anglo-Saxon "Pul" meaning a steep hill. The farm is now owned by Henry Bond, a sheep and cattle grower. The house and several neighboring houses were renovated in 1896, but in 2002 still had no inside electricity. In 1524 John Wolcott of Bovey Tracy was listed on the Lay Subsidy Roll paying a tax on &pound18 in goods. He was then the third wealthiest Wolcott in Devonshire, so he must have prospered in the tin business. John also paid a tax on &pound12 in the lay subsidy of 1543-5, again indicating that he was fairly wealthy. A John Wolcot held land in Newton Abbot, a village 7 miles south of Chudleigh. The land bordered property that John Gavercock sold to John Wyle in 1547. John Wolcott of Chudleigh did not hold land here when he died in 1549, so the land may have belonged to John Wolcott of Pullobrook. John of Pullbrook married Margery. Parish records show that Margery Ulcot was buried at Pullobrooke, Bovey Tracy 1549 and John Wolcott of Pullobrooke was buried 1554.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(7) Richard of Shute, c.1510-1552. There were two Richard Wolcotts who lived in the parish of Bovey Tracy. One lived at the farm called "Shute", immediately adjacent to Pullobrook, and is therefore probably the son of John of Pullbrook. Shute means "water source". Bovey Tracy parish registers show that Richard Wolcott married Margaret, whose last name is not given, on the first week of All Saints, 1538. When John Herte granted a tenement to John Southcott of Bovey Tracy in 1537, Richard Wulcote and John Bucke served as attorneys for the transaction, according to Tingey's Calendar, folio 14. Richard Wolcott paid a tax on &pound3 on the Lay Subsidy Roll of 1543-5. Folio 252 of that calendar shows that Richard Wolcote of Shute, Bovey Tracy, yeoman, purchased land from John Herte's son, Robert, in 1552. Richard Ulcot of Showt was buried at Bovey Tracyin 1552. Apparently Richard's widow, married William Quicke 1553 at Bovey Tracy.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(8) Welthian, daughter of Richard and Margaret Wolcott, 1539-1540 Bovey Tracy.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(8) John, son of Richard and Margaret Wolcott, b. 1541 Bovey Tracy. He is probably the John Wolcott who was buried at Bovey Tracy 1591. John Wolcot married Joan, daughter of Andrew Underhay 1565 at Bovey Tracy. Joan Wolcott, widow, was buried at Bovey Tracy 1609. For 1567, Tingey's Exeter Castle Mss., folio 252 records: "John Woolcot, husbandman of Bovey Tracy, bargain and sale to Gregory (or Henry) Ley of Bovey Tracy, merchant, lands there which John Mannvile (or Mannynge) holds; boundents, heirs of Clysthanger, heirs of Edward Collyns, and the way towards Liseleghe." This may have been the John Wolcott who was at Ashburton in 1579 of whom the parish records show that in that year the church wardens of Ashburton parish paid John Wolcott 3s 8d for making beams for the Lemmynford bridge. There are no Wolcotts listed on the muster rolls for Ashburton in 1569. In 1599, John Woolcott's name is found on the subsidy rolls at Ashburton, paying a tax of 16d. In 1596, one of the two Wolcotts who paid the Bovey Tracy Church Rate Tax was Joan Wolcott, who paid a tax of 10d for a tenement at Pludde, a hamlet in Bovey Tracy. This Joan was probably John's widow

In 1596, one of the two Wolcotts who paid the Bovey Tracy Church Rate Tax was John Woolcott, who paid 20d for a tenement in Elsford, a hamlet in Bovey Tracy parish. It is difficult to distinguish this John from his second cousin, John Wolcott, son of John and Joan, born at Bovey Tracy in 1569. In 1596, John Bearde held Shute.

</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(8) Richard, son of Richard and Margaret Ulcot, b. 1546 Bovey Tracy. This may be the Richard Wolcott, carpenter, who was buried at Bovey Tracy 1570, and brother of the John Wolcot who built the bridge at Ashburton in 1579.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(8) William, son of Richard Ulcot of Shut and Margaret, b. 1549-1551 Bovey Tracy.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(7?) Margery, c.1520-. Margery Wolcott married John Rowland at Bovey Tracy 1543.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(6) William, c.1480-1550. An entry in the Wreyland Manor accounts for 1500, says that William Wolcott was assigned with John Merdon, Sr., as pledge. William would have been born some time before 1486, and was probably the son of Thomas of Wreyland. An entry for 1501 again says that William Wolcote was with John Merdon, Sr., as pledge. This is probably the William Wolcott was involved in a Chancery hearing about 1520. In this dispute, John Dawe, son and heir of John Dawe of Newton Abbot complained that his father had held half a tenement in Moreton Sampford which he had enfeeoffed to John Paynter and John Webber and their heirs, after which both John Dawe and John Webber died. John Dawe, the son, then claimed the land as his inheritance and John Paynter released all of his interest in these lands to him. William Wolcott and John at Wylle, however, entered upon the land claiming title to it, a claim which John Dawe, the younger, disputed. It apears that William Wolcott and John Atwell claimed the land as heirs of John Webber, so they may have been his son-in-laws. The death of this or another William Wolcott was recorded at Bovey Tracy as: "1550 - William Ulcot de Crowd Subito obit in via Newton", that is, he died on the road to Newton. There is a Crowde in the parish of Harberton, 15 miles south of Bovey Tracy. Newton was probably Newton Abbot, the town 7 miles southeast of Bovey Tracy where the John Dawe lived who brought suit against William Wolcott in 1520.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(7) Richard, c. 1505-. William seems to have the father of one of the two Richard Wolcotts who lived at Bovey Tracy, probably the one who married Thomasina. Richard Wolcote of South Tawton is listed on the 1525 Subsidy Roll, paying a tax on &pound1 in wages. Richard Wolcot, "maritq", of Spreyton, a village 3 miles northeast of South Tawton, was buried 1558 at Bovey Tracy. This was probably this Richard because his youngest son was born in 1559. "Maritus" is Latin for husband. Thomasina Wolcott was buried at Bovey Tracy 1572.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(8) John, c. 1530-1569. The Bovey Tracy parish records begin in 1539, before a John Wolcott, who seems to have been Richard's eldest son, was born. John married Agnes and had a number of children who were baptized at Bovey Tracy. In 1569, John Wolcott, "the caryer", was buried at Bovey Tracy. A carrier was a person who made regular trips to larger cities to make purchases or deliveries for the villagers. Agnes Wolcote, probably John's widow, married Jordan Langdon at Bovey Tracy 1571.

<div class="descendantDiv">(6?) William Wolcott, c.1480-c.1540. Thomas Wolcott took up land in Wreyland manor in Bovey Tracy, Devonshire in 1479. William Wolcott presumably his son, is first mentioned in the Wreyland Manor records of 1500 as being in frankpledge there. Part of Thomas' land was called Milland and was located on the Wrey River adjascent to Lustleigh Mill. William Wolcott appears on the 1524 tax roll at Bovey Tracy, taxed on &pound3 of goods. His name is not on the 1525 Bovey Tracy tax roll, so he must have died or moved from there at that time.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(5) Thomas Wolecote - Joan d. of Wm Colbrooke 2 son of John Colbrooke of Chittlehampton. Chittlehamton is a town 2 miles northeast of High Bickington. Thomas is given in the 1620 Visitation record as younger brother of Richard "Wolecot" of Chagford who was born about 1430. If so, Thomas was born soon after.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">Thomas may have been the Thomas Wolcott who was at Moreton Hampstead in 1453. In 1453 Thomas Wolcote of Moreton Hampstead, a parish bordering Chagford, groom, and others of Moreton were charged with tresspass and assault on Richard French, Jr.. He would have been young man, probably operating a stable. A contemporary Wolcott at Moreton was John Wolcott, tailor. In 1472, Steven Collsyll, parson of North Bovey, was executor of the estate of John Wollcote of Moreton, tailor, collecting debts from people at Moreton Hampstead and Bovey Tracy. In 1472, Walter Wolcote, husbandman, and John Wolcote, junior, butcher, both of Morton Hampstead were named in a trespass case. In 1473 John Wolcote of Moreton Hampstead, tailor, and others were accused of taking goods and animals of John Netherman. In 1483, John Wolcote, tailor, and three others, were assigned the task of settling a dispute over lands in Chagford. 1486 John Wolcote of Moreton, tailor, was a witness to a trust to which John Wolcote of Chagford was a trustee. The names of Walter, Henry and John Wolcott are found on the Moreton Hampstead subsidy rolls of 1524. Walter was taxed &pound2 and Henry and John &pound1.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(6) Walter Wolcot - Elizab, d. of Wm. Lampry & of Elizab. his w., d. of Walt. Baghell als. Beale of Yeoland in High Bickington., c.1480-c.1550. In the 1620 Visitation he is said to be the son of Thomas Wolecote and that he married Elizabeth, daughter of William Lampry and Elizabeth, daughter of Walter Baghell or Beale of High Bickington. Walter was taxed on &pound3 in goods at High Bickington on the Lay Subsidy Roll of 1524. Thomas and John, presumably his brothers are also listed as paying similar amounts. Walter was taxed on &pound8 on the Lay Subsidy Roll of 1543.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">There were three Wolcotts at High Bickington in 1525: Walter, Thomas, and John, and four in 1543: Walter, Thomas Sr., Thomas Jr., and Emota, widow. Walter's father, Thomas, might have still been alive in 1525, but it is highly unlikely that he could have been alive in 1543. It seems most likely that Thomas and John were Walter's sons.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">The Wolcotts of High Bickington nearly always spelled their name "Wollacott", a spelling which helps distinguish this branch of the family from other Wolcott families. Two Wollacotts have participated in the Wolcott/Walcott DNA projects, and neither showed DNA similar to Wolcott/Woolcott participants. Further participants are desired for this project.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(7) Thomas Wolcot fil et haer, c.1510 -1546. According to the Visitation, Thomas married, Margery, daughter and coheiress of John Davy and Margery Eston, daughter and coheiress of Thomas Eston of Morchard Bishop. Thomas is taxed on &pound4 in goods on the 1524/5 Lay Subsidy Roll, living at High Bickington, and Thomas Wollacott Sr. was taxed on &pound4 on the Lay Subsidy roll of 1543-5. Among the correspondence of the Lisle family is a letter to Lady Lisle dated 1533, from John Wolcott of High Bickington, servant of Sir John Bassett, saying that goods belonging to Richard Edward had been sold to Thomas Wollecott. The will of Thomas Wollacott of High Bickington dated 1546 was proved at Exeter, but was destroyed in the bombing of Exeter in World War II. Apparently Thomas died when his sons were infants. According to the Visitation, Thomas Wollacott had three sons, John and Thomas, twins born in 1544, and John, the younger.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(8) John Wolcott the elder, geminus, aetat 76, superstes 1620, 1544-1627. John registered the family pedigree during the 1620 Heralds Visitation, naming 2 brothers, Thomas his twin, and John the younger. John Wolcott of High Bickington was listed to serve as a pikeman on the muster rolls of 1569. He was probably the John Wollacott, Sr., who was buried at High Bickington in 1627. John would have then been 83 years old at the time of his death. The "wife of John Woullacott" was buried at High Bickington in 1597.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">John's son, John held 1/3 interest in properties at High Bickington and Crediton in 1639, indicating that the three brothers, John, Thomas and John shared their father's property equally. The tax assessment rolls of 1581 shows five men with the name spelled Woollacott. Thomas Wollacotte of High Bickington, who was assessed on &pound7 of goods, must have been the twin born in 1544. He would have been 37 years old at the time of this tax. John Wollacotte of High Bickington, assessed on &pound3 of goods, was probably one of his brothers. John Wollacote of Crediton, assessed on &pound8 of goods, may have been their other brother. George Wollacotte of High Bickington, assessed on land valued at &pound1 per year, was probably the George who was on the High Bickington muster rolls in 1569, possibly a cousin. Nicholas Wollacote of Merton, assessed on &pound7 of goods, may have been an uncle or cousin.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(9) John, c.1570-1633. High Bickington parish records show the names of John Sr. and John Jr.. John Wollacot married Joan Ball at Mamhead in 1593, and was a church warden at High Bickington in 1614 and 1616. An Inquest Post Mortem taken at Torrington 1639 states that John Wollacott died at High Bickington in 1633 siezed of one third part of a tenement of 120 acres at Grattercliffe in High Bickington, one third of the rents from a tenement called Shuttleigh in High Bickington, one third of a tenement with 48 acres of land in Northeale in High Bickington, one third of a tenement with 98 acres of land in Eastacombe in Addrington, one third part of two tenements with 38 acres of land in Crediton, one third of a tenement with 37 acres of land at Millford in Frithelstock, and one third of 4 acres in Littlehaselwood in Sampford Peverell; and that John Wollacott, his son and heir, is 30 years of age and over, that is, born prior to 1606.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(10) Katherine Wollacott, c.1597-1597. John and Joan were probably the parents of Katherine, daughter of John Wollacott, Jr., who was buried at High Bickington 1597.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(10) John, son of John Wollacott of Yoeland, b. 1601 High Bickington, baptized with brother, Thomas, probably twins. John inheirited one third of the Wollacott property in 1639. Probably the John Wolacotte who married Mary Rogers at Atherington 1634 and signed the 1641 Protestation Return at Atherington.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(11) Mary, daughter of John and Mary Wollacot, b. 1642 Atherington.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(11) Joan, daughter of John and Mary Wollacott, b. 1644 Atherington.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(11) Margaret, daughter of John and Mary Wollacott, b. 1646 Atherington.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(11) William, son of John and Mary Wollacott, b. 1649 Atherington.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(10) Thomas, son of John Wollacott of High Bickington, of Yolland, b. 1601; baptized with brother John. In the Visitation pedigree of 1620, John Wolcott, the twin, stated that his great grandfather was Walter Beale of Yooland in High Bickington. At a later date, a George Downe of Pilton, sailor, left a bequest to "my tennant Thomas Wollacott of Yolland in High Bickington." The farm, west of the village of High Bickington, is now called Yelland. One of the two Thomas Wollacotts of High Bickington who signed the 1641 Protestation Return . John Woollacott (c.1680-1743) died at Yooland.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">In 1641 all men over 18 were required to sign an Oath of Allegiance to the Crown.Those from High Bickington signing in 1641 were: John, Joseph, Richard, Samuel, Simon, Thomas, Thomas, and William Wollacott. From Crediton: Walter, George, and Robert Wollacott. Others were Northam: John Wollacott; Oakford: William Wollacott; North Tawton: John Wollacott; Atherington: John Woolacott; Chittlehampton: Hugh Wollacott.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">In 1723, men over 18, who were freeholders and copyholders of land, were required to sign a similar oath. William Wollacott, Robert Wollacott and John, Roger and John Woollacott of High Bickington took the Oath, the latter three signing next to each other in that order. All signed with their mark, except fot the last John who signed his signature. They were:
William Woollacott, c.1670, ancestry unknown.
Robert Woollacott Jr., c.1655-c.1735; son of Robert, below, heir to Eastcombe and North Heale.
John, Woollacott, c.1680-1743, son of Robert, above.
Roger Woollacott, c.1695-c.1760, grandson of Robert, above.
John Woollacott, Jr., 1695-1737; grandson of Robert, below, heir to Gratleigh.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(11) Robert Woollacott, c.1630-1703 High Bickington, probably son of Thomas Woollacott because his great grandson lived at Yooland als. Yelland, continues the senior branch of the Woollacott family at High Bickington. The 1603 will of Robert Woolacott of High Bickington, yeoman, extracted 1842, bequeathed to son, Robert, his lands of Eastcombe and North Heal; and to son John, lands of the tenement of Gratleigh, and mentions land called North Heale and Marsh tenements in High Bickington. Gratleigh and East Combe were held in three parts by John, Thomas and John Woollacott in 1633, above. Gratleigh Farm is adjacent to Yelland Farm in High Bickington.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">In 1829, John Wollacott, then of Uffculm, yeoman, agreed to pay &pound1,500 and indemnity for costs and retainer to Mr. C. Gravel for John's claim to the Gratleigh estate in High Bickington, late in the possession of Rev. Peter Johnson of Ringsash. The dispute lasted many years. In 1830 Mr. Gravel recorded a pedigree of the Woollacott family in this legal dispute. The Gravel pedigree reads:
"(1) Robert Woolacott, testator, died in 1703, m. Dorothy. Will of Robert Woolacott of High Bickington, yeoman, who died 1703 mentions Gratleife estate, Eastcombe, North Heale and Marsh tenements, all in High Bickington.
(2)? Unnamed son, John, c.1665-1710).
(3) John, baptized at High Bickington, died 1737, married, and had issue, Ann Mooland who was afterward Ann Sage.  She died in possession of the Estate and her oldest son John took it on her death and not on the death of his father in 1746.

An attached statement by Henry Reppen sent to the Reverend Peter Johnston at Wembworthy, alleges fraud and that John Woolacott is entitled to estate of Gradley Farm.als. Gratleife or Grattley. Rev. Johnson apparently prevailed, because in 1857 he leased Gratley messuage and tenement to John Webber of High Bickington.

In 1569, a muster of able bodied men at High Bickington lists Thomas Wollacot as one of the four presenters in charge of the muster, and states that he had goods valued at between &pound20 and &pound30 per year and therefore was required to provide a bow, a sheaf of arrows, a steel cap, a bill and a harquebus. He was also mustered as an archer, as was George Wolcot, who was probably his uncle. The tax assessment rolls of 1581 shows Thomas Wollacotte of High Bickington assessed on &pound7 of goods. He would have been 37 years old at the time of this tax. In 1570 Thomas Woullacott of High Bickington, yeoman, conveyed to Anthony Coplestone of Weke, gent., ½ of 3 tenements called Southworthe and Durdon in Bradworthy and Woolfardisworthy which were in the tenure of Richard Woode, John Jorye and John Cleverton.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">Thomas Wollacott married Joan Penecott in 1585, at Black Torrington, a village 15 miles south of High Bickington. If this is the same Thomas he would have been 41 years old, so this may be his second marriage. Thomas' two daughters were baptized at Great Torrington in 1586 and 1587. There is a Wollacott memorial in the parish church of Black Torrington. In 1609, Hugh Speke of Hazelbury, Wilts., Thomas Wollacott, gent., and William Wollacott, esq., purchased the manor of Box and Wadswick in the parish of Batheaston, a village in Somerset 3 mi. south of Wivilscomb. Thomas apparently died shortly thereafter. Hugh Speke was made a baronet in 1669 and died in 1661.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(9?) William Wollacott, c.1575-. A William Wollicott married Mary Wilmot on 1600 at Merton, a village 8 miles souuthwest of High Bickington. He may be the William Wollacott, esq., named with Thomas, above, in the purchase of the manor of Box in 1609.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(10) Joan, daughter of William Wollicott, b. 1601 Merton.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(9?) Mary Wollacott, c. 1580-. Mary Wollicott, possibly William's sister, married John Hatherleigh 1601 at Merton.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(9) Sarah, daughter of Thomas Wollacott, b. 1586 Black Torrington.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(9) Anstys, daughter of Thomas Wollacott, b. 1587 Black Torrington.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(9?) Thomas Wollacot married at Winkley, a village 8 miles northwest of North Tawton in 1600. Mary, daughter of Anstis Woolacott, was baptized here in 1619. These may perhaps have been related to the Anstis who was born at Black Torrington, daughter of Thomas Woolacott of High Bickington.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(8) John the younger. John, born about 1550, is named in the 1620 Visitation.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(7) John Wollacott of Crediton, c.1530-87. A John Wollacot married Mary Preston at Crediton in 1558. This is too old to be John, the eldest twin born in 1544, and was probably his uncle, born about 1530. John Wollacott is listed on the Crediton muster roll of 1569 to serve as an archer and the tax roll of 1581 shows John Wollacote of Crediton taxed on goods valued at &pound8 per year. John Wollacote was buried at Crediton 1587. The will of a John Woolcott of Crediton was recorded at the Exeter Principal Probate Registry, number 2380, in 1587. A will of Joan Woolacott of Crediton was proved at the Exeter Probate Registry in 1602. This was probably the "Widow Woollacott" who was buried at Crediton 1602. She may have been John's second wife for this seems the only Wolcott widow expected to be found at Crediton in 1602.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(8?) Nicholas Wollacott, c.1545-c.1590. Nicholas was about the same age as the John Wollacot who registered the family pedigree in 1620, and may have been his cousin. Nicholas Wollacott is listed on the Merton muster rolls of 1569, and on the Merton tax rolls of 1581 taxed on &pound7 in goods. Merton is a village 3 miles southwest of High Bickington. He is listed in 1569 to serve as an archer, and also as one of the presenters, usually leading citizens of the parish who certified that the muster list was correct. Nicholas is also listed as having to furnish arms because he had goods valued at between &pound10 and &pound20 per year, the same value as Thomas Wollacott of High Bickington. This may be the Nicholas Wullacott who, according to the Burnet-Morris Index, served as an attorney for William Way in 1569.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(8) George, son of John Wolcot, b. 1564-1634 Crediton. This was probably the George Woolacott who married Thomasine Provess at Exeter in 1597. Grace, wife of George Wollacott died 1631 at Crediton. In Chancery Proceedings in 1626, Wolcott v. Hele, W48/19, and Wolcott v. Rowe, W16/22, it is recorded that George Wolcott of Crediton, yeoman, claimed that he had borrowed various sums of money fron Gregory Hele of Crediton, yeoman, and had paid them all back. George was requesting the assistance of the court to obtain his bond, and to make th Heles admit the payment to them and release him and his son, Walter. Crediton parish records show the burial of one Henry Barrents, "at George Wolcotes" in 1631. Crediton parish records also records the burial of Grace, wife of George Woolcot in 1631, and the burial of George Woolcott of Woodland in 1634. Woodland must have been George's farm. The will of George Woolcott of Crediton, widower, was proved in 1638.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(9) Walter Wollacott, c.1598-1649. George' son, Walter, was named in the Chancery Proceedings of 1626. Walter was also involved in another Chancery Proceeding in 1637. In this case, numbered W48/53 and W109/21, Walter Wollacott, son of George Wollacott of Crediton, yeoman, deceased, stated that his father had held a tenement and land known as Cadworthy, in Crediton Manor, copyhold. In about 1634 George had leased this land to William Perry, husbandman, of Crediton, on a full repairing lease. With the lease expiring the next month, Perry had been cutting the trees to sell, not to repair the house, which was in ruins. He had cut down 100, and threatened not to leave one standing on the Cleeve. Perry, in reply, said that he had cut no more than 40 trees, all for firewood and repairing, though he admitted that he had sold some firewood. He said that there were 460 trees left. Walter Wolcott signed the Protestation Return at Crediton in 1641. The will of Walter Woolcott, yeoman of Crediton, dated and proved 1649, leaves 20 shillings to the poor of Crediton; 50 pounds to his son, John, a minor; 60 pounds to his daughters, Alice, Thomasine, and Joan, all minors; and the remainder to Joane Woolcott his wife who he makes executrix; with John Bornell and Richard Skinner as overseers.

</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(?) Luce, daughter of Isott Wolcot, 1626-1626 Crediton.
</div>

</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(7?) George Wollacott, c.1535-. George Wolcot of High Bickington, listed to serve as an archer on the muster rolls of 1569, was probably another son of Walter Wollacott.

</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(8?) Thomas Wollacott, c. 1570-. Thomas Wollacott who lived at High Bickington may have be another son of George as he named his eldest son, George. This Thomas Wollacott married a Joan, and had children baptized at High Bickington. He was probably one of the two Thomas Wollacotts who signed the 1641 Protestation Return at High Bickington.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(9) Joan, daughter of Thomas Wollacott of Middlewood, b. 1601 High Bickington.

</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(8) Simon Wollacott, c. 1575-1645. Simon Wollacott of High Bickington was probably Thomas' brother because Thomas named a son, Simon, in 1616. Simon Wollacott married Katherine Pawe in 1602 at High Bickington, and Simon Wollacot of High Bickington married Anne Saunder of Chittlehampton at High Bickington in 1616. The will of Henry Saunders of Chittlehampton, dated 1642, and proved in 1645, leaves bequests to his wife, Mary: his son, Arthur Saunder and Arthur's daughter, Elizabeth; his daughter Ann, wife of Simon Wollacot, and their children Henry and Ann; his daughter Joanna Ley; and his daughter Agnes, wife of Phillip Wollacott, and their son, Arthur.

It leaves to the church and the poor of the parish of Clovelly 3 shillings 4 pence each;" to each of my God Children two shillings a peece if they come for it Also my will is that my Executrix hereafter in this Will named shall after my death deliver unto my sonne Robert Wollacot my best brasen crock and my best brasen pann which I gave to him in marriage Also I give and bequeath unto my Grandchild Joahne Wollacot daughter of my said sonne Robert Wollacott five shillings Also I give and bequeath unto my daughter Elizabeth Prush five shillings Also I give and bequeath unto my sonne Robert Wollacot five shillings Also I give and bequeath unto Joane Woollacot the Wife of my said sonne Robert five shillings Alsoe I give and bequeath unto Gideon Littlejohn sometyme my servant tenne shillings Also I give and bequeath unto my Grandchild William Woollacot sonne of my said Sonne Robert all my household goods Waines Ploughstuffe of all sorts and Implements of household and husbandrie whatsoever after my death But my will is that my Executrix hereinafter named shall have the use of the same during her life att her Will and pleasure All the rest of my goods and chattles not herein given or bequeathed my ffunerall expences discharged and my debts and Legacies paid I doe wholie give and bequeath unto Mary Woollacott my daughter whom I doe make and ordaine my sole and onlie Executrix...." and "...

</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(7) John Wollacott, c.1495-1543. John is listed on the 1524/5 Lay Subsidy Roll living at High Bickington, probably the son of Walter and brother of Thomas. He is probably the John Wolcott of High Bickington, servant of Sir John Bassett, who sent the letter to Lady Lisle dated 1533, saying that goods belonging to Richard Edward had been sold to Thomas Wollecott. Sir John Bassett lived during the reign of Henry VII, married Jane Beaumont, heiress of land at Atherington, and is buried in Atherington Church. John Wollacott's will, proved in 1545, states that he was to be buried in the churchyard of the Church of St. Nicholas at Bickington, with his entire estate going to John Shaptor, in trust to provide for John Wolcott's wife as long as she lived. This indicates that he probably had no children who survived. The Emota Wolcot, widow, who is on the 1543 Subsidy Roll at High Bickington was probably his widow.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">A Wollacott family lived at Bideford, a village about 8 miles southwest of Barnstable, near the coast. Pure subjecture, but the might be descendants of Thomas, so placed here.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(7?) John Wollacott, c.1525-. John Wollecott married Phillis Weche alias Ossell at Westleigh by Bideford 1565. The muster rolls of 1569 shows that a John Wiche of Bideford was assessed on goods valued at &pound10 per year, comparative wealthy for the time. Simon Weche of Bideford is listed on the same muster roll to serve as a pikeman. These were probably Phillis' realtives, and Ossell may have been her first husband. John probably settled at Bideford at the time of his marriage to her. His wife may have been the Phillipa Wollacott, widow, who was buried at High Bickington 1610.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(8?) William Wollacott, c. 1550-. Also on the 1569 Bideford muster roll of 1569 is a William Wollacott of Westleigh about 2 miles from Bideford. William was too old to have been the son of John Wollacott and Phillis Weche, but he may have been John's son by a previous marriage. William Wolecot married Elizabeth Laerey, or Laverney, at Westleigh by Bideford 1576.

<div class="descendantDiv">(9) Thomas, son of Rowland Wollacot, b. 1600 Bideford.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(8?) John, c.1565-1614. John Wolcott, Sr., of Bideford, whose will was proved at the Exeter Probate Registry in 1614, may have been a son of John Wolcott and Phillis Weche, who married at Bideford in 1565. He may be the ancestor of some of the other Wolcotts who lived at Bideford.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(9) John. He may have been the John Wollacott who signed the Protestation Return at Northam in 1641.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(9?) Thomas Wollocott m. Alice Kelly 1602 Westleigh.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(9?) Elizabeth Wollacot m. Mylchard Berry 1615 Westleigh.

<div class="descendantDiv">(9?) Mary Wolcott, who had a daughter, Wilmot who was baptized at Bideford 1630.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(9?) William Wollacot, whose son, Thomas, was baptized at Bideford 1634.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(10) Samuel Woollacott, c.1665; said to have come to Bideford from Wexford, Ireland, during the Irish Rebellion of 1688. Samuel was a member of the Great Meeting Independent Church at Bideford in 1700. He had sons Samuel and John. Samuel Woollacott was the father of Elizabeth who d. 1810, and Samuel, 1732-1804.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(6?) Mantell, c.1460-?. The Subsidy Rolls for 1524 and 1525 give the name of three Wolcotts at Moreton Hampstead: Mantell Wolcott taxed for &pound2, Henry Wolcott taxed for &pound1, and John Wolcott taxed for &pound1. It is uncertain who these men were, but because this village is just one mile east of Chagford it seems likely that they were related to John Wolcott of Chagford. When John's eldest son, John Wolcott of Chuleigh, died in 1523 he held 3 houses and 130 acres of land in Moreton Hampstead; his son, John of Exeter, held 2 houses and 48 acres there, and when his son died in 1555 he held none at all. Mantel, Henry, and John may have lived on the Wolcott property there. Mantell is a very strange name and perhaps it is a misreading for Walter. As Mantell had a bit more property than the other two men, he may have been their father and Henry and John his sons.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(7?) Henry, c. 1500-1565?. An adult resident of Moreton Hampstead 1524-5. Henry Wolcott of Drewsteignton was taxed on &pound8 on the Lay Subsidy roll of 1543-5. The will of Henry Woollcott of Drewsteignton, a village 6 miles east of Chagford, dated 1565, was filed at the Exeter Probate Registry. This may have been the Henry Wolcott living at Moretonhampstead in 1525.

The name , John, appears twice on the Chagford list in 1524 but only once on the 1525 list, so it is possible that there was only one John here. In 1542, John Wolcote and Alice, his wife, were tenants in land in Southteign Manor at Chagford which was conveyed by John Seyntill to John Comyng of Horselake and John Smyth, tinners. Allerpark, Wallake, and tinworks in the jurisdiction of the Chagford Tin Court are mentioned in this deed, which is listed in Tingey's Calendar, pages 39-40. John Seynthil was the primary landowner here in 1525 when John was a tenant. This may be the same John who was at North Tawton in 1567. John and Alice Wolcott both died at North Tawton in 1580.

Wollacott and others. Then in 1571, Valentine Rolle, gent., sold to Henry Rolle of Staverton, his brother, the reversion of a moiety of land in Talbot's Weke in North Tawton, in the tenure of John Woulcott and others. All of these seem to refer to the same land and to John Wolcott who was a tenant there from 1567 to 1571.

Andrew Wolcott, the elder, was involved in Chancery Proceeding in 1641, in a suit brought by his brother-in-law, Matthias Chappington, gent., of South Molton. Matthias stated that he had planned to sail to Brazil, and having no wife or children, he wished to leave his house and land at South Molton to his sister, Sarah, and her children in case he did not return. The land was put in trust in 1623 for himself and his heirs, with reversion to Sarah and her children. In 1625 he gave Henry Hill a 99 year lease on the property. Henry died the next year, and his widow, Joan Hill, soon after, so the property came to their son-in-law, Henry Hearder. Matthias went to Brazil where he stayed for 11 or 12 years. While he was gone, Henry Hearder and Andrew Wolcott, barber, announced that he was presumed to be dead and Andrew the sole owner. Two years past they entered into an agreement whereby Henry was to pay Andrew &pound60 for the land and another &pound50 in three years if Matthias did not return, and Andrew gave Henry a trust deed as security. Matthias then returned and tried to reclaim his land, but Andrew and Henry charged him with breech of contract.
