<div class="descendantDiv">The second Wolcott to arrive in the American colonies was John Woolcott, who immigrated to America in 1634. John was a son of Edward Woolcott of Axbridge, Somerset, mercer and mayor of Axbridge, by his wife Marie Phippen. Edward was a son of John Wolcott of Tolland, son of Thomas Wolcott of Tolland, son of Thomas Wolcott of Tolland, and was therefore a second cousin of Henry Wolcott who immigrated in 1630. The Woolcott spelling used by early generations of this family is a variant spelling of Wolcott, the spelling used by most American Wolcotts today. Woolcott continued to be the preferred spelling in England.
</div>

<hr class="thick">


<div class="descendantDiv">
(1) John Woolcott, b. Axbridge, Somerset, 1599, d. 1638 Watertown MA. After the death of his first wife, Mary Wrentmore, John immigrated to America on the Recovery of London, which departed from Weymouth, Dorset, in 1634. He was admitted as a freeman of Cambridge MA in 1635. His daughters, Elizabeth and Mary, either came with him, or followed soon after. Shortly after arriving in America, John Woolcott married Winifred Longman Crawford of Watertown. She was the widow of John Crawford who drowned in the Charles River in 1634. Winifred had two children from her first marriage, Martha and Rebecca. John's surname was usually spelled Woolcott, a spelling that some of his descendants continued using.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">John was probably the John Woolcut who owned property at Salem MA in 1635, when William Lord of Salem bought from John Woolcut a house in Salem built by Francis Higginson and later occupied by Roger Williams. The Baptist leader, Roger Williams, was ordered expelled from Salem in 1635, and fled to Rhode Island in January of 1636. The sale of his house was apparently part of the process of forcing him to leave. John purchased the property from Mrs. Higginson of Charlestown, the town directly adjacent to Cambridge, part of which became Watertown.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">John Woolcott of Watertown died in 1638, and an inventory of his estate was taken at Salem.  In that same year his daughters, Elizabeth and Mary Wolcott, petitioned to have their uncles, Richard Vayle of Glaston, Somerset, yeoman, and Christopher Atkins, mercer, act as guardians of their lands at Glastonbury, Somerset.  These lands were apparently entailed to the children of John and his first wife.  A note in the margin of this document reads, "write to Henry Wolcott of Windsor in NE at M. George Searle, mercer, in Tanton, and Edward Woolcott of Axbridge in Somerset, mercer, they to be made guardians." John Woolcott left a large debt of 388 pounds owed to Edmund White of London, which may have been borrowed by John Crawford or John Woolcott for speculating in land in America.  Winifred repaid the debt in 1641 by deeding to Edmund White eight properties at Watertown, totalling 160 acres, which she and John owned at the time of his death.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">Winifred, widow of John Woolcott, deceased, was recorded as a grantee of 6 acres in the town plot and of a farm of 183 acres, and was a proprietor of this and four additional lots of land at Watertown in 1644. Winifred later married Thomas Allyn of Barnstable MA. In 1649, Thomas Allyn and his wife, Winifred, signed another deed giving properties at Watertown, including a house that had been Winifred's, to Edmund White of London.  This appears to have been the same properties Winifred signed over in 1641, so the 1649 deed was probably a quit claim signed after her marriage to Thomas Allyn. Thomas Allyn died in 1679.  His will, dated 1675, mentions his children, Samuel, John, and Mehitable Annabelle, and Samuel's son, Thomas.  Samuel Allyn, was born in 1644, and John Allyn in 1646. Thomas' daughter, Mehitable was born in 1648 and married Samuel Annabel in 1667.  Some or all of these children may have been from a first wife, for Samuel Allyn was born about the same time that Winifred Wolcott was recorded as a widow living at Watertown. Thomas Allyn's will also mentions his "daughter-in-law", Sarah, William Clark's wife, and Martha, Benjamin's wife, and his "daughter-in-law" Rebecca, wife of Samuel Sprague.  These "daughters-in-law" were the children of Winifred by her previous marriages. Winifred's daughter, Rebecca Crawford, born about 1633, married Samuel Sprague at Boston in 1655.  This couple were living at Malden MA in 1662. Samuel Sprague died in 1696, and Rebecca then married Capt. John Browne, dying in 1710 at age 77.  Sarah Clark was the child of Winifred and John Wolcott.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(2) Elizabeth Woolcott, bapt. 1622 at Glastonbury, Somerset, accompanied or followed her father to Massachusetts. Elizabeth Woolcott, married David Offley of Boston c.1639. Although his residence is usually given as Boston, David Offley lived at Plymouth in 1643 and was the proprietor of a "homestall" of 16 acres at Watertown MA in 1644.  No children are known.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(2) Mary Woolcott, bapt. 1624 Glastonbury, Somerset, accompanied or followed her father to Massachusetts. Mary was living in 1638, but no record has been found of her marrying.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(2) Martha Woolcott, bapt. 1629, Axbridge, Somerset. Both Martha and her mother seem to have died shortly after Martha's birth.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(2) John Woolcott, b. c.1636 MA, d. 1690 Brookfield MA. John first appears in the records of Newbury MA in 1653 when John Woolcott and his future father-in-law, Richard Thurlow, voted against the expenditure of &pound24 a year for a free school at Newbury. As both were carpenters, it appears that John was Richard's apprentice and probably lived in his home. John married Richard's daughter, Mary Thurlow, later that year at Newbury.  In 1653 the general court of Massachusetts issued an order proscribing preaching by individuals who were not approved by the elders of four neighboring churches or the county court. Lt. Robert Pike of Salisbury MA objected to the order as being an infringement upon the rights and privileges of freemen. He was summoned to the general court, where he was disenfranchised, banned from public office, fined, and required to post bond to ensure good behavior. Citizens of Haverhill, Andover, Hampton, Salisbury, and Newbury filed petitions asking that his punishment be revoked. John Wolcott was one of 39 men from Newbury who signed the petition in 1654. The court ordered an investigation of the signers. John Woolcott and seven other men of Newbury who refused to retract their complaint were fined for their action.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">John Woolcott signed a petition to settle at Pennacook NH. He was one of several petitioners from Newbury who in 1659 received a grant of land eight miles square on the Saco River near Wells ME. In November of 1659 John contracted to buy 200 acres of land with a house and barn at Wells ME from Thomas Kimball of Hampton NH, who sued him for half the purchase price in Essex Court in 1662. There is nothing to indicate that he ever lived there, except a reference which says that John was a witness at Wells in 1660. Although he later contracted to do some building there, he apparently found the location uninviting and returned to Newbury. In 1662 John was censored and fined for sitting in the front pew of the Newbury parish church. After considerable litigation he was assigned a "foreseat in the north row". This happened again in 1669, and this time John Woolcott and Peter Tappan complained that the selectmen, without consulting the town, had placed a pew in front of another occupied by "some who paid considerable sums to the building both of the meeting house and the galleries", apparently the complaintants. John's father-in-law was also involved in dissention within the church. In 1671 he participated in an attempt to remove the pastor, Thomas Parker, from office. The attempt failed, and Richard Thurlay was fined 4 nobles.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">John was regularly involved in litigation. His father-in-law had constructed a bridge over the Parker River between Newbury and Rowley, in 1654. A new bridge was funded in 1661. Ezekiel Northend and John Picard subcontracted the work to John Woolcott. This bridge was said by them to be inadequate when completed in 1662. John agreed to make alterations, and in 1663 the court ordered the county treasurer to make final payment to him, but he was not paid until 1664. In 1666 Northend and Picard sued John for witholding money due them, but their suits failed. In 1664 John Woolcott of Newbury, carpenter, contracted to build a mill for Walter Barefoot and Robert Wadleigh in Maine. Among Wadleigh's disbursements for the sawmill on the Lamprill River in an accounting dated 1664 was 40L to John Woolcott for wages. Nathaniel Clark bought 7 acres of land at Newbury from John Wolcott in 1664. In 1666 John was also sued twice for non payment or underpayment of wages, and lost both suits. An undated entry in Essex County court also records the suit of William Waldron vs. John Woolcott, Sr. of Newbury, with a move for dismissal.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">John owned a homestead of 100 acres at Newbury. Some time before 1661 he also bought 300 acres in Rowley from a Mr. Nelson for &pound200. Half of this amount was to have been paid off by building a house and a barn on Nelson's land at Merrimack by the end of 1663. The balance was to be paid in corn and livestock. In October of 1661 John sold half the land to a Nicholas Wallington. He built the house and barn, but evidence was given in 1667 of bad workmanship and late completion. Testimony was also given of only partial payment of the balance. John tried to discredit two of the witnesses. There was also dispute over a boundary line and John was accused of stealing a document from Nelson. John countersued Nelson for selling land that was not his and lost the suit. Wallington sued John for non-performance, and he too lost.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">John and Mary Woolcott purchased land at Haverhill from John Hazeltine in 1673. They sold this land to a Nathaniel Chaney for &pound30 in 1674. John served as Deputy Constable in 1666.  In 1669 he was taken to court by his apprentice, William Harrison, for not fulfilling their contract. In 1671 he was involved in an attempt to remove the Newbury pastor. In 1675 John bought a parcel of land adjoining his own, giving mortgages to a John Knight and John Atkinson. By 1682 he had sold this land to Atkinson for &pound50. There was a dispute over the amount, but John prevailed. In 1682 John and Joseph Woolcott, apparently the sons, were accused of taking cordwood from Joseph Atkinson. The Woolcotts insisted that the wood was theirs.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">He took the Oath of Allegiance in 1678. In 1679 John Wilcott of Newbury, millwright, contracted to build a windmill at Marblehead for William Bowditch and several associates for &pound160. When completed, the structure and workings were found to be inadequate, and the Marblehead men refused to pay, whereupon John filed suit for payment. John and his son, John, testified that Bowditch had not shown up at meetings to evaluate the work, and that Bowditch's associates had signed releases. John countersued Bowditch and lost, and was subsequently fined for not prosecuting his appeal.
Regulations issued by the town of Newbury in 1682 indicate that John Woolcott's residence was in the "third range of sheep", lying between the Mill Bridge and Trotters Bridge, near the upper Green. The records show that he owned 54 sheep in 1683. John sold 50 acres of his homestead and freehold rights at Newbury in 1687 for &pound250, reserving two freehold lots. He sold another 30 acres of land in north Newbury for &pound30.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">John then moved his family to Brookfield MA, where his son, John, had settled the previous year. The deed to his land-grant at Brookfield, dated 1687, reads "granted to Mr. Woolcott 40 acres of upland bounded West by his son John's land." He had another 20 acres adjoining the land of his son, Joseph. He died three years later. John's will, recorded at Northampton MA, reads: "John Woolcot of Squabaug alias Brookfield, his last wil & testamt as follows. Dated in Brookfield this 21 day of Septr 1690. This by the will of Mr. John Woolcot is given to his daughter Mary fifteen pound and to his daughter Sarah fifteen pound and to his daughter Elizabeth thirty pound wch Legacy is to be paid as my wife is able or she shall se cause & al the Rest of my goods I leave wth my wife for her life tyme & maintenance & after her death to be divided among my three daughters wch are unmarried equally among ym. And to my Two sons my two pieces of Land at Newbury and my farm at Watertown wch Lands is to be divided equally between ym. And I give my Two sons al my Land & meadow here onely my son John is to have this part where the house standeth. And as for Jeames (a slave) I leave him wth my wife for her life & after her decease to be free...." The estate amounted to something over 700L. The family quarrelled over distribution of the estate, and the court assigned sole distribution to his widow, Mary. A year later, an accord was reached and ratified by the court. Apparently John received the larger share, for Joseph remonstrated so violently that he was hauled into court and fined for his actions. Subsequently, John, Jr., and Joseph, with the widow, Mary assenting, sold 22 acres of common land at Newbury for &pound50.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(3) Mary Woolcott, b. 1654 Newbury MA, d. c.1700.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(3) Sarah Woolcott, b. 1657 Newbury MA, d. 1717 Rehoboth MA; m. Thomas Chadwick of Newbury 1674 Newbury MA. At the Ipswich Quarterly Court, Sarah, daughter of John Wilcott, was presented for having a child born in March, Thomas Chadock being the reputed father, witnesses Elizabeth Browne, midwife, and Mary, wife of John Wilcot. They married shortly thereafter and Thomas gave "satisfaction" to the church at Newbury. They moved to Watertown MA in 1678.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(3) dau., 1659-1659 Newbury MA.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(3) John Woolcott III, b. 1660 Newbury MA, at age 15 was one of Capt. Appleton's Troopers, who were sent in September 1675 on an expedition to protect the settlements on the Connecticut river then menaced by the Indians. As the line of march took the company through Brookfield, it is likely that he was favorably impressed with the location where he afterwards made his home. His name is found on military rosters of February and August 1676 during the Naragansett Conflict.   His service may have not been entirely voluntary, because  in August of 1676 an order was issued to the Constable of Marblehead to impress six men for military service, one being John Woolcott. The following year John Wilcott of Newbury is listed as having been paid &pound4 10s for military service in King Phillips War.  His family was paid this amount by the town of Marblehead for his being absent on military duty. In 1676 John and Mary Wilcott gave testimony at Marblehead, giving their ages as 24 and 18 respectively, possibly a first wife who died shortly thereafter.  Both John and his father took the Oath of Allegiance at Newbury in 1678, giving their ages as 18 and 45 respectively. In 1680 John Woollcot, aged 19, gave testimony concerning a windmill built at Marblehead by his father, John Woolcott of Newbury.   John married(1) Mary ____ c.1680, m. (2) Johanna Emerson 1684, recorded at Newbury and Ipswich.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">John settled at Brookfield MA in 1686, being one of the first settlers to come there after the community had been destroyed by the Indians under King Phillip. He and his brother, Joseph, and four other men, soon built a house. Their father joined them the following year. In the fall of 1688, Mr. Woolcott was in charge of the garrison then stationed at Brookfield, probably consisting of he and his brother and neighbors defending his fortified house. He was granted a license to run a public house at Brookfield in 1693, which he probably did in his home. Some time before 1717 he built a gristmill at Brookfield which he operated. In 1718 he also built a sawmill on the Five Mile River, for which he was granted 40 acres of upland at Brookfield. His land holdings were extensive, and in 1717 he was the sixth wealthiest man in town. He was a leading man in civil affairs, selectman in 1727, and active in the church. He built a larger house in 1723, part of which was a tavern. He and his wife transferred all his property, including the tavern, to their son, Nathaniel, in 1747, "for his kindness to us in our old age".
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(4) Jonathan Woolcott, b. c. 1680.  In 1734, Jacob Symonds drew land at Amhurst, Hillsborough Co., New Hampshire, for Jabez Crocker on the claim of Jonathan, son of John Walcot of Marblehead, based on his military service.  Amhurst was created by land grants given to soldiers who had participated in King Philip's War. Jabez Crocker, who resided then at Lebanon, Grafton Co., New Hampshire, was the son of John III's sister, Hannah, who married Samuel Crocker in 1697.

</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(4) John Woolcott IV, b. 1695 Brookfield MA; mentioned in Rev. Fisk's "Historical Discourse": "Oct. 13, 1708, early in the morning, John Wolcott, a lad about 12 or 14 years old, was riding in search of the cows when the Indians fired at him, killed his horse under him, and took him prisoner.... John Wolcott, the lad above mentioned, was carried to Canada where he remained six or seven years, during which time by conversing wholly with Indians he not only entirely lost his native language but became so naturalized to the savages as to be unwilling for a while to return to his native country." He returned to Brookfield and was granted 40 acres at Brookfield 1718, 60 more in 1719, 20 more in 1720, and 80 more in 1721; served in Capt. Wright's Co. 1723-5.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">John "Wilcott" m. his sister-in-law, Dinah Walker, 1727 Brookfield MA. Dinah Woolcott m. (2) Peter Rice 1730 Brookfield MA. The Rices moved to Western MA, where Peter died in 1759 and Dinah died in 1785. It was at Western that her grandaughters, Rebecca and Charlotte Woolcott, married in 1794 and 1797. Abner Wilcott, the "Loyalist", is said to have visited Charlotte in Vermont in 1800.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">John was reported killed by Indians on the upper Connecticut River in 1728 while returning from a hunting trip with a cargo of furs. He is now believed to have deserted his family and returned to live among the Indians. He may have lived at Wilcott Island above Fort 4 on the Connecticut River. The town of Allenstown, granted to the Allen family in 1722, was first settled by John Wolcutt, Andrew Smith, Daniel Evans and Robert Buntin, who with others were there previous to 1748. In 1747 Bunton and his ten year old son, Andrew, were captured on the west bank of the Merrimack River by Indians and taken to Canada from where they escaped eleven months later, an event similar to John's youth. John is thought to have taken another wife after returning to the wilderness, and raised several more children.

<div class="descendantDiv">An article about this, by John B. Wolcott, published in the April 2008 Wolcott Family Newsletter, appears below:
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">THE ILLUSIVE WILCOTTS
         Our Wolcott DNA project has established some genetic patterns, one of which connects several of our "missing link" families to the Wolcotts of Brookfield, Massachusetts.  Some of these families spelled their surnames "Wilcott" in the early records.  Most of their descendants later used the "Wolcott" spelling and definitely carry Wolcott DNA.  These "missing links" start in 1772 when a John Wilcott appeared in Pennsylvania and Abner Wilcott appeared in Connecticut.  DNA tests of their descendants show that John and Abner's descendants had identical DNA. Several other families, that of Paul, Silas, John, David and Barnabas Wilcott, all of Pennsylvania, shares the same markers, and were almost certainly sons of John and brothers of Abner.  In addition to the unique DNA markers these families share, they also carry a marker that is specific to the Brookfield Woolcotts.  Woolcotts at Brookfield are few in number and quite well documented.  There are very few Brookfield Woolcott males who could have been John's ancestor. 
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">         John Woolcott, born at Brookfield in 1695, aroused our interest as the probable ancestor to these missing links.  His had a very interesting story: "Early on the morning of October 13, 1708, John Woolcot, a lad of about 12 or 14 years old, was riding in search of the cows, when the Indians fired at him, killed his horse under him and took him prisoner…. John Woolcot, the lad above mentioned, was carried to Canada, where he remained for six or seven years, during which time, by conversing wholly with the Indians, he not only entirely lost his native language, but became so naturalized to the savages, as to be unwilling for a while to return to his native country. Some years afterwards, viz. in March 1728, in a time of peace, he and another man having been hunting, and coming down the Connecticut River with a freight of skins and fur, they were hailed by some Indians; but not being willing to go to them, they steered for another shore. The Indians landed at a little distance from them, several shots were exchanged, at length Woolcot was killed." 
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">         When John returned to Brookfield in 1718, he was given 40 acres of land.  The following year he was granted another 100, a year later another 70, and a year after this another 70 acres.  In 1724 his father gave or sold him 41 additional acres at Brookfield, in which deed he is referred to as a "husbandman" or farmer. Six years later, in October 1727, he acquired a wife, the sister of his younger brother' wife.  It was only a few months later that John went up the Connecticut River on the hunting expedition from which he never returned.  In June 1728 his wife delivered a son whom she named John.  It is our opinion, based on historical and DNA evidence, that John IV probably did not die on the Connecticut River in 1728, as had been reported, but instead went back to the Indians with whom he had lived for many years. The subsequent tale of his death in a fight with the Indians was probably a story to explain his disappearance.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">         Silas, son of John Wilcott of Pennsylvania, served in the Revolutionary War.  His widow applied for a military pension in 1840, saying that Silas had been born in New Hampshire. The upper Connecticut River where John of Brookfield went on his last hunting trip in 1728 led right up to New Hampshire.  An account of settlers at Charlestown, New Hampshire, being captured by Indians in 1754, says that they were taken up the Connecticut River to Canada.  On the first day of their abduction, they moved ten miles up the river "to the upper end of Wilcott's Island", where they crossed the river on rafts.  An article in the New England Gazeteer, dated 1839, says that there were three islands in the Connecticut River near Charlestown, New Hampshire, a ten acre island called Sartwell's island, and two smaller island of about six acres each, with rich, loamy soil This island is now quite small, but it may have suffered considerable erosion in the past centuries.  It seems a likely spot to have harbored John Woolcott, a possibly wife, and their children.  John is said to have been fluent in the Algonquin language, which was spoken by the native people of this area.  If this is correct, John apparently spent the latter part of his life as a hunter and trapper on the upper Connecticut River, avoiding contact with his Brookfield family. 
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">         The upper Connecticut River was the home of the St. Francis tribe of the Western Abenaki Indians.  This tribe numbered about 1,800 members at the time, having been decimated by diseases brought by the European settlers.  Their headquarters was the village of St. Francis on the St. Francis River, which joins the St. Lawrence River between Montreal and Quebec.  At this time it was a village of about 40 homes, with a Catholic church and a resident Jesuit priest.  From the village of St. Francis, the St. Francis River went south to a portage trail that connected with the Connecticut River, forming an important Indian trail between Connecticut and Quebec.  The St. Francis tribe spoke the Algonquin language, but many also spoke a little English and French.  They regarded the upper Connecticut Valley as their tribal hunting grounds, and seem to have had a penchant for raiding the English settlements to the south for loot and for captives whom they took as slaves, adopted into their families, or sold to the French to be ransomed back to the English. 
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">         A typical story of the time is that of Jonathan Dore, a twelve year old boy captured by the St. Francis Indians in 1746.  In 1759 "he suddenly made his appearance in Rochester, after an absence of thirteen years and a half. His story was as follows:  He "was treated kindly and adopted into the St. Francis tribe, to which his captors belonged. He married an Indian girl at an early age, and had several children. He acquired the habits and disposition of an Indian, and almost forgot that he was descended from another race.  He bore a part in all the cruelties at the taking of Fort William Henry. A white man whom he was pursuing turned upon him just in season to arrest the descending tomahawk, and then Dore saw a face which had been familiar to him in the days of childhood. The recollection of his father's fireside and the happy scenes of his boyhood instantly rushed upon his mind; his arm fell by his side; he walked back to the fort overpowered by the long-forgotten associations so unexpectedly and so vividly revived within him, and took no further part in that horrible tragedy. From that time he thought often of his boyhood home, but his wife and children bound him to the Indians with ties too strong to be severed."  Jonathan's wife and children, with most of the Indian residents of the village of St. Francis, were slaughtered by New Hampshire's Rogers' Rangers in 1759 and he returned to his people.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">         The origins of Charlestown, New Hampshire, ten miles down the Connecticut River from Wilcott's Island, began in 1738 when Township Number 4, then the northernmost English settlement on the Connecticut River, was chartered.  White settlers arrived in 1740 and came to number 8 or 10 families.  Relations between these settlers and the natives were quite good until 1744 when the conflict between the English and the French, known as King George's War, began.  At that time the Indians moved north and the area became a war zone.  By 1760 the French had been defeated, the natives had been driven into the wilderness, and a wave of British settlement advanced north and west, pushing the Indians before them.  John IV would have been 49 in 1744 when war began, and his presumed son, John Wilcott of Pennsylvania, about 15. There is no record of them at Township Number 4, so they probably went with the Indians to Canada, or west into the New York wilderness. 
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">         Here, John of Pennsylvania, would have come of age and married.  His known sons, Paul, born 1752, Silas born in New Hampshire in 1755, John, born 1759, and David, born 1762, have descendants who share the Brookfield DNA marker, and two additional markers found only in their descendants.  The two additional markers are not found in descendants of John 's first son, John Woolcott, born at Brookfield in 1728.  All three of these markers are found in descendants of John's other sons, as well as in descendants of Abner Wilcott, born 1747, and Barnabas Wilcott, born in Pennsylvania in 1767, both of whose parents were previously unknown.  This DNA and the birth dates indicate that these six men were probably all siblings.  All these children's names are Biblical names. Silas and Barnabas were disciples of the apostle, Paul, and Abner was the general who introduced David to King Saul's court.  Several of the names are not found previously in any American Wolcott families, indicating a complete separation of the family from their Wolcott relatives and probable religious training by the Jesuits who ministered to the natives. 
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">         This suggests that John left his island home in New Hampshire and moved west into New York, and down into Pennsylvania, arriving between 1755 and 1770.  A legal hearing in 1810 contained testimony that "Wilcott was the only settler in Penn's Valley in 1772."  Penn's Valley is a beautiful valley on the West Branch of the Susquehanna River.  This area was ceded to the British by the Indians in the Treaty of 1768.  In 1773, John Wilcott was one of five men appointed to lay out a road from there to Sunbury, a settlement at the confluence of the north and west branches of the Susquehanna River.  In 1776 John Wilcott was one of 54 men from the area who signed a request for arms to defend themselves against the British and the Indians.  In 1778 he was listed at Bald Eagle, with two horses and four cows.  He had apparently left his Indian contacts behind and become a part of the European settlement.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">         All of John's probable sons seem to have been roving frontiersman types.  Abner married in Connecticut, went with his wife's family to New Haven Township, then in New Hampshire, in what had been the St. Francis Abenaki tribal lands.  There they became Loyalists and settled in Quebec on an island in the St. Lawrence River.  The second son, Paul, served in the Continental Army, married in Pennsylvania, and moved to Ontario, Canada with his wife's family.  The third son, Silas, was known as "a great hunter", served in the Continental Army, married in Pennsylvania, and moved up the Susquehanna to the wilderness of New York where he was one of only two white settlers.  Fourth son, John, served in the Continental Army, married, and lived on an island in the Susquehanna River which had been an Indian trading spot.  He moved into the wilderness of Kentucky about 1800, were he remarried and raised a family.  Fifth son, David, moved over the mountains into Ohio shortly after 1800.  Barnabas moved to North Carolina before 1790, and then to Kentucky about 1800.  All spelled their name Wilcott on their earliest records, although most later switched to Wolcott.

John signed a petition to create a Second precinct in Brookfield in 1748. He served in Capt. Burk's Company in 1756, and marched to the relief of Ft. William Henry in Capt. Upham's company in 1757, during the French & Indian Wars; he was administrator of his son Timothy's estate in 1779; m. Experience Walker, Brookfield MA. 1790 Brookfield, Worchester Co. MA.

<div class="descendantDiv">(6) Timothy Woolcott, b. 1749 Brookfield MA, d. 1778; farmer; he was a member of the Brookfield militia and marched to the Lexington alarm of April, 1775 in Capt. Ithmar Wright's Company from Brookfield, serving 8 days.  On 3 May 1775 he and his brother, Solomon, enlisted for 8 months as Corporals in Capt. John Granger's Company, Col. Ebenezer Learned's Regt.. This unit fought at Bunker Hill, although no rosters of this event have been found.  In 1776 Private Timothy Wilcott served in Capt. Thomas Wellington's Co., 2nd MA Inf. Bde.. In 1776 Congress provided for the formation of a regular army , providing for enlistmen of men to serve during the war.  A bounty of 20 pounds was to be paid at time of enlistment, and enlisted men were to receive 100 acres of public lands.   Among those who enlisted for 3 years was Timothy Woolcott.  He was assigned to Capt. Fish's Co., Col. William Shepherd's 4th Regt., Massachusetts Line, for a term of 3 years and was in this unit at Valley Forge in Dec. 1777.  When the Continental Army left Valley Forge they moved to Monmouth, New Jersey, where they attacked the British column leaving Monmouth.  The battle was fought to a standstill and the British withdrew, but Timothy sustained wounds at Winrock Creek in June 1778 from which he died. 
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">Timothy's widow filed for administration of his estate in 1779: "Hon.

<div class="descendantDiv">(5) John Wolcott/Wilcott, c.1730-c.1780. According to the History of Center County Pennsylvania (John B. Linn, 1884), John Wilcot was the first settler in the present township of Potter, which was organized in 1774. It is located in central Pennsylvania in the Appalachian Mountains, and was officially opened to settlers in 1769. In a court case, Miles v. Potter and Barber, 1810, it is recorded that George McCormick testified: "Wilcot was the only settler in Penn's Valley in 1772. He lived where Earlytown now is." Earlytown is also in Potter Township. John Wilcott was one of five men appointed in 1773 to lay out the road from the east end of the Great Plain west to Sunbury. The Great Plain is adjacent to Penns Valley. John Wilcott was one of the 54 men of Bald Eagle and Potter who signed a request for arms and ammunition in 1776. In 1778 John Wilcot is listed at Bald Eagle in Potter Township as having 2 horses and 4 cows but not holding any land, never having gained legal title to the land on which he lived.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">In 1778, Indians massacred the family of Jacob Stanford at Bald Eagle. Stanford's daughter was found dead on the path leading to the home of John Willcot, their nearest neighbor. This appears to be the same story told by Silas Wolcott's granddaughter, Etta Wolcott Park: "Polly Stanton, one of the neighbor girls used to say: 'Mrs. Wolcott, if the Indians ever come this way I shall run down to your house for you have so many guns'. One day Silas went out hunting. He had been gone some time when the postman came in great haste. 'Mrs. Wolcott', he cried. 'Do you know all your neighbors are being killed by the Indians? If you women and children can get onto my horse, I will try to get you to the fort.' 'I will stay and wait for Silas', said the grandmother. Margaret Wolcott did not say who the old lady was.... I understood her to say it was the grandmother of the children. ...Margaret spoke of her as 'the old lady'. Margaret got on the horse with her babe in arms, the other two children in front. They had got about halfway to the fort when the baby began to cry. 'You will have to leave that baby,' said the postman. 'I can take no chances on that.' Margaret would not leave her baby, so got off the horse and walked all the rest of the way to the fort. Back home the old lady bolted the doors and placed guns at all the windows.... When Grandfather returned home there was no one there but the old lady. His family he found at the fort. All the neighbors had been killed and their houses burned, his being the only house left standing and his the only family left living. Polly Stanton was up the road, dead scalped. She had tried to get to their house as she had said she would do."
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">Although Etta thought this had taken place later at Havana, New York, there were no Indian problems at Havana while Silas lived there. Because of the hard winter of 1779-80 and problems with the Indians, most settlers left Penns Valley at that time, but many returned in 1784. No records were kept between 1780 and 1784, but in 1784 Paul Wilcot and Silas Wilcot held land at Bald Eagle, where John had lived and where the massacre had taken place.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">(6) Abner Wolcott, b. 1749 NH, d. 1833 Sorrel, Quebec; married Catherine Griffin at Oxford CT in 1772, purchased 150 acres of land at New Haven VT in 1775. He was a Loyalist who hauled provisions for the British army, and was taken prisoner in 1777. His estate was declared forfeited to the State of Vermont and included 150 acres of land, 65L in cash, 4 oxen, 6 cows, 7 sheep, 11 pigs, and clothing and personal effects with a total value of &pound335. In 1778 he escaped to Canada where he was given compensation for his losses by the British government in 1783 at Sorel, Quebec. By 1787 he had settled on Isle St. Bouchard in the St. Lawrence River, in Vercheres parish. In 1798 his children, John, Abner (Louis Abner), Solomon, and Catherine, renounced their religion and joined the Catholic Church, probably to enable them to marry Catholics. Abner and his wife were buried in a Protestant cemetery. He and son, John, returned to Vergennes, Vermont, about 1800, and soon after he returned to Canada where they took the Oath of Allegiance to the Crown in 1803. During this 1600 visit to Vermont he is said to have visited Charlotte Wolcott, b. c.1773, who married Hosea Bridges 1797 at Western MA. His will dated 1825 left his estate to wife Dolly, and to his 10 children after her death. He drew up a later will in 1831 leaving &pound4,000 to his grandson, Andrew, which his son, John was to hold until Andrew became of age, and some property to his second wife. In 1831, Abner and Dorothy sold land at William Henry, later Sorel, Quebec, to Aaron Allen for &pound125. On this document both Abner Woolcott and Dolly made their "x", "the said Woolcott & wife having declared they cannot write have made a cross in lieu of their signatures". In 1833 he is described as of William Henry. Abner's death record says he died 1 Aug. 1833 at Sorel, Quebec, age 86, which if correct would make his birth date 1747. His children and widow had a dispute over his will; m. (1) Catherine Griffen 1772 Oxford CT, m. (2) Mrs. Dorothy Redman 1821 Sorel, Quebec. NOTE: Members of this family usually spelled their name Wilcott or Willcott in Canada, but some later changed to Wolcott when they returned to the United States.

PA, and was at Goshen in 1778. A militia roster for Dauphin Co. PA dated 1786 lists Paul Wilcot "gone out of these parts." Paul Wilcott paid taxes at Bald Eagle PA in 1784, in 1786 on 1 horse and 1 cow, in 1787, and in 1788, but is not on tax list in 1789 or 1793.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">Paul's father-in-law, Jonathan Ashbridge, and Isaac Williams were expelled from the Groshen Friends Society for refusing to reconcile a quarrel. Goshen Friends records for 1777 say that "Jonathan Ashbridge removed to a remote part of the Susquhanna River, and Elizabeth and Hannah, two of his daughters, are since married." Northumberland Co. tax roll for 1778-80 shows Jonathan Ashbridge taxed on a valuation of &pound6, 13 s. Letters of administration of the estate of Jonathan Ashbridge, late of Northumberland County, were granted to his wife, Sarah, and Robert Martin in 1782. Bald Eagle, then part of Northumberland Co., tax rolls for 1785 shows “Heirs of Jonathan Ashbridge" taxed on 100 acres at 3s 9d as non-residents. Goshen Friends accounts for 1785 say: "Sarah Ashbridge, widow, who removed many years ago without a certificate is settled far remote from friends & hath wholly declined to attend meetings; also declines to request a certificate & is therefore disowned." A warrant dated 1785 states: Whereas....Sarah Ashbridge...has requested to take up 300 acres of land, in trust for the heirs of Jonathan Ashbridge, decd., including an improvement made before the year 1780 by said Jonathan Ashbridge on the North side of the West Branch of the Susquehannah half a mile below Pine Creek...she agrees to pay...at the rate of 30 pounds per hundred acre...." In 1786 and 1787, Jonathan's widow, Sarah, was taxed in Northumberland County. In 1786 she was taxed on one horse and one cow at 2s 9d, and in 1787 on 300 acres of land, 1 horse, and 1 cow at 1L 10d. The land was sold in 1790 to James Davidson for &pound457, and in 1793, Sarah, her sons John and Jonathan, and daughters Elizabeth Wilcott and Mary Mills, and their families, moved to Canada.

<div class="descendantDiv">In 24 Aug. 1796, Paul purchased 38 acres of land at York, now Toronto, Canada. He also received a patent on 200 acres of land at York, Ontario, and sold the land to John Small in 1801. Part of this land is now the Ontario Jockey Club. He is on the 1805 census of York with wife, 4 sons, and 3 daughters. A cabin said to have been buil by Paul Wilcot about 1807, is located on Wilcot Creek, and is said to be the 3rd oldest building in metropolitan Toronto. It is now the site of the Edwards Garden. Paul enlisted in 1813 as a Private in a unit of Canadian volunteers to serve the United States' cause in the War of 1812. A muster roll of 1813 reports that he had been wounded in the side by a cannon shot. Pauk Willcutt was of Scarborough, Ontario when he married (2) Sarah, widow of Ezekiel Younglove, in 1814 at Toronto, and then moved to Ohio where he settled on the Maumee River. In 1820 Paul Wolcott gave a deposition at Waynesville, Warren Co. OH in support of his brother, Silas', military pension request.

<div class="descendantDiv">(6) Silas Wolcott, b. 1755 NH, d. 1834 Litchfield Township, Bradford Co. PA; bur. Park Cemetery, Litchfield PA. Etta Wolcott Park, Silas' great-grandaughter, said that Silas “grew up in New Jersey and Easton, Pa.", possibly meaning Jersey Shore, on the Susquehanna River, near Bald Eagle. An affidavit was given by Jonathan Havens: "Mr. Wolcott was brought up in Chester Co. Penna. where records of marriages are seldom made." Chester Co. is where Silas' brother, Paul was married in 1777. Silas grew up in the wilderness and was an excellent marksman.  He enlisted at age 21 and served from April 1776 to January 1778 as a rifleman in Capt. Caspar Weitzel's Rifle Company, Col. Samuel Mile's Regiment, 13th Pennsylvania Line. The regiment moved to Philadelphia on 2 July 1776, and after the Declaration of Independence was signed marched to Trenton and then to Perth Amboy.  They fought to defend Long Island, but were forced to retreat. Silas took part in the Battle of Harlem Heights, the defense of Fort Washington, and the retreat across the State of New Jersey.  He was in the Battle of New Brunswick, and the Battle of Trenton on Christmas Day 1776, followed by the Battle of Princeton.  Silas was in Capt. John Robb's Company, Col. Steward's Regiment, at the Battles of Brandywine and Germantown in the fall of 1777.  The 13th Pennsylvania moved to Valley Forge, where, family tradition holds, Silas was a bodyguard for General George Washington.  Silas was mustered out at Valley Forge on 1 January 1778 and returned to Bald Eagle. He married Margaret Rowan in 1778 at Lancaster PA. In 1784 Silas Willcot paid taxes at Bald Eagle, Northumberland Co. PA, his name is listed next to David Wilcot; Silas was also on the Bald Eagle tax roll in 1786 for tax on one horse. He was on the roll in 1787. His name is on the tax roll for 1788 but was crossed out, he apparently having departed. This was the year of the Indian massacres at Bald Eagle. Silas was issued a land warrant for 400 acres of land in Bedford Co. PA on 8 July 1784, and in 1788 he paid taxes in Huntingdon Co. PA on 395 acres of land as a non-resident. Huntingdon Co. was formed in 1786, partly from Bedford Co. Silas' brothers, John and David, were subject to military duty in Huntingdon Co. in 1786.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">In 1788 Silas is recorded as the first settler, at Catherine's Creek, New York near the later town of Havana. Settlers were later given the option of purchasing their land, and if they did not, they were required to leave. He is said to have later moved to land near Ithaca NY, but there has been no record of this found. He was probably living near Litchfield, Bradford Co. PA during 1802-7 when 3 of his children married members of the Park family of Litchfield. Silas applied for a military pension in 1818: "Silas Wolcut of the township of Athens in the County of Bradford...did declare and say that he was born the fourth day of August 1755 in the State of New Hampshire". Silas stated that he was living at Northumberland Co. PA when he enlisted there, had served as Private in Col. Miles Regt., 13th PA Line, and was discharged at Valley Forge, Chester Co. PA 1 July 1776. An 1820 a deposition by brother Paul Wolcutt, age 67, of Waynesville OH stated that the children of Revolutionary war soldier Silas Wolcott were Benjamin, Elijah, Mary, Dorcas, Loviah, John R., Minerva, Margaret. The pension files state that Silas died 4 or 5 June 1834 Litchfield, Bradford Co. PA.  In 1839 his widow applied for a pension. Her deposition states that Silas m. Margaret Rowan who was b. 12 Oct. 1756 and resided with her son, Benjamin age 44, in Athens, Bradford Co. PA where the family had resided for 48 years, (since 1791). Benjamin stated that her children included Elijah, age 58 on 29 March 1834, Mary Munn, Dorcas Pew, Loviah Cushman, John, Minerva Read, Margaret Park, and 2 more children who d. in infancy.

<div class="descendantDiv">(6) John Wolcott, b. 1759, and apparently living in 1835. John enlisted in late summer of 1777 as a private in Capt. James Eilson's Company, Col. Chambers 1st Pennsylvania Regt.  He re-enlisted on 7 December 1778 at Sunbury, Pennsylvania, as a Private in Capt. McClellans Co., 1st Regt., Pennsylvania Line, to serve until 1781.  He was captured by the British near Montgomery, Pennsylvania, on 29 June 1779, during the Battle of Fort Muncy. Fifty-two American prisoners were taken. The old men and women were released and returned to Fort Augusta at Sunbury.  He said in his pension claim that "the first night after they were taken prisoner they spent the night in an ash house in Muncy, Northumberland Co., Pennsylvania.  He was kept in captivity six months and then was exchanged.  He rejoined the American Army."  He was discharged in the fall of 1780.  John Wilcut of Bald Eagle Township was assessed on 2 horses and 4 cows and 100 acres of land.  His brother Paul was also assessed at Bald Eagle. John and his brother, David, were subject to military duty in Huntingdon Co., Pennsylvania, in 1786. 
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">He probably had two wives, the first being Sarah Wolcott who moved her family from Pennsylvania to Ohio.  Her children were born from about 1787 to 1799.  There is no record of where the first four were born, but the last three are said to have been born in Pennsylvania. Sarah apparently left John and took the children to Ohio, shortly after 1800.   Family tradition is that she and her children came to Ohio from Perry Co., Pennsylvania, by wagon train.  Perry Co. is in Central Pennsylvania, on the West bank of the Susquehanna River. They were in Franklin Co. in 1807 and 1810 when her daughters married.  In 1813, Sarah Woolcott was in Franklin County, Ohio, as the administrator of the estate of William Johnson of Franklin County, possibly her father or brother.  Sally Wolcott deeded property in Columbus, Franklin Co., Ohio, to John Kerr in 1820 and 1822.  Her name appears on the 1820 Sandusky Co. census with 1 male born 1775-95, 1 male born 1810-20, and 1 female born 1775-95, two males with dates that appropriate for the ages of her sons, John and Peter.  Sandusky County was formed in 1820. In 1822 and 1826, Sally is found on a tax roll for Ballville Township, just outside Sandusky.  Ballville was once part of Franklin County.   It is adjascent to Sandusky Township and Washington Township.  The will of Sally Wolcott of Sandusky Co., Ohio, proved 1824, leaves bequests to her children, Jemima Grant, Elizabeth Sells, Christina DeVault, John, Sally Williams, Peter, and Lydia Thomas.  Most of these daughters were married in Franklin County, Ohio.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">John applied for a military pension 2 Oct. 1818 at Bourbon Co. KY, stating that he was 59 years old, residing in Bourbon Co., and had been captured by the British near Ft. Montgomery in the winter of 1779 and taken to NY where he remained in captivity for about 6 mo., after which he was released and rejoined the American army in the summer of 1780 near Morristown NJ. He was discharged in NJ in the fall of 1780. His affadavit says he was indigent and has a very helpless family incapable of contributing. A supporting deposition from his brother, David, taken before the Hon. Samuel Reed at Pike Co. OH in 1818, recalled that his brother enlisted 1777 as Pvt. in 1st PA commanded by Col. Chambers. On 1 July 1820, John Walcott, age 61, residing in Bath Co. Kentucky, gave a statement at Aureysville, Bath Co. KY, stating his occupation as farmer, and that he had war injuries of one ball through right leg, one ball through left thigh, and one ball that broke the left wrist, and that he had a wife age 40, and children: Kitty 16, Hannah 14, Rueben 12, Hetty 10, Christina 8 , Fanny 6, Lucinda 4.
</div>

<div class="descendantDiv">On 1 April 1823 John Walcott certified that he had resided in Ohio for 8 months and previously had resided in KY and PA. A letter from Records Div, General Accounting Office to VA Director of Pensions regarding John Walcot, pensioner KY, states that payment covering the period 4 Sept. 1832 to 4 March 1833 was made to David Osborn in Cincinnati OH 26 March 1833 as attorney for the petitioner. On 4 March 1833 John certified that he had resided in Montgomery Co. OH for 11 months and previous to that had lived in Green Co. OH. John Walcott is on the 1835 pension roll as Pvt. Pat. Continental 75th, transferred from KY to Pike Co. John's second wife may have been the Elizabeth Wolcott who died 1823 Pike Co. OH. John's daughter, Hattie Wolcott Brownlee, says in a 1894 article she was b. 1794 (sic.) in a cabin on the bank of Scioto Creek OH, that an older sister d. age 105 and her father at 95, and she had a younger sister, Mrs. Eliza Pratt, age 88 living same city (Macon Co. IL?). Her obit says she b. Bourbon Co. KY. A 1931 membership application says John m. (1) Sarah _____ 1790 Pine Creek PA and she d. 1802, m. (2)_________ c. 1802. John is said to have lived on Long Island, adascent to Jersey Shore. Long Island was an island in the Susquehanna River near where Pine Creek joins the Susquehanna. Letters of Marian Elizabeth Wolcott Green, granddaughter of John's brother Silas, says that her father had visited John Wolcott on Pine Creek, and that John Wolcott lived there and his brothers, Paul and Silas, had lived there with him. In another letter she stated that her grandfather was a Revolutionary soldier and that “his brothers John & Paul were too young and could not join, that they done border duty in Penna…." Mrs. Green stated “John Wolcott's last marriage cut him off from his family and they did not know what became of him or where he died". Pine Creek runs through Lycoming, Tioga, and Potter Counties. Children formerly said to have been John's first family were actually children of his brother, Paul.

The "History of Sandusky County" says of Ballville Township: "Among the settlers of 1818 in the north part of the township were David Moore, Asa Gavit, John Wolcut, Mr. Rexford, Mr. Chaffee, and perhaps a few others" and "John Wolcott was known in early times as a hunter, which was a profitable employment, in fact it was the only employment which brought in ready cash; labor and farm products were paid in trade. He was a native of Pennsylvanua and lived with his mother after coming here." John Wolcott paid tax on land and personal property at Sandusky in 1826 and taxes in 1835. John's will proved 27 Oct. 1848 bequeathed all his property to his wife, Hannah. The "20th century History of Sandusky Co. OH says John Wolcott came from Perry Co. PA and settled at Mud Creek with Josiah Topping and David Grant c. 1823. In 1806 Josiah owned land in Franklin Co. OH. In 1826 Josiah Topping and Josiah H.

Hattie gaves confused accounts of her youth. She said that she was born in Bourbon Co., Kentucky. Her father was in Bourbon Co. in 1818. She also said that "she was born in a cabin on the banks of the Scioto Creek, near Columbus, Ohio. At that time the Indians were very troublesome in Indiana, and a great portion of her life in that state was filled with hardship. They came to Illinois 35 years ago," which would be 1863. She claimed to be 106 years old in 1898, therefore born in 1792. In the 1850 census she gave her age as 45, and 1860 as 55, therefore born in 1805. She was apparently even younger. Her obituary says she was married in Kentucky, and moved with her husband to Indiana. Census records show that they were in Parke Co., Indiana in 1830, Vigo County, Indiana, in 1840; Macoupin Co., Illinois, in 1850, and Madison Co., Illinois, in 1863.

<div class="descendantDiv">“In North Brookfield, Massachusetts, just off Slab City Road, sits an enormous dam that was once was the site of Woolcott's Mill, which was established in 1717 as a sawmill. For years, the mill site carried a stigma of misfortune each time the property changed hands – everything from an owner's disappearance to an accidental tragic shooting of a child by his brother, and even one poor soul losing his arm in an industrial accident at the site. In an effort to explain the odd and sometime ghoulish happenings, local residents blamed it on an unknown woman who simply was referred to as ‘Aunt Hepsie'." (Haunted Quaboag - Fact or Fiction, by Paula Slade) Her grave stone reads: "Hepzibah, Daug. of Cap. John & Rebecca Wilcot of Brookfield, died Dec. 27, 1846."
